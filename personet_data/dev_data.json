    "history": "Valentine, whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented to our readers without formally introducing her, was a tall and graceful girl of nineteen, with bright chestnut hair, deep blue eyes, and that reposeful air of quiet distinction which characterized her mother.Her white and slender fingers, her pearly neck, her cheeks tinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely Englishwomen who have been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan.She entered the apartment, and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had already heard so much, saluted him without any girlish awkwardness, or even lowering her eyes, and with an elegance that redoubled the count’s attention.He rose to return the salutation.“Mademoiselle de Villefort, my step-daughter,” said Madame de Villefort to Monte Cristo, leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards Valentine with her hand.“And M. de Monte Cristo, King of China, Emperor of Cochin-China,” said the young imp, looking slyly towards his sister.Madame de Villefort at this really did turn pale, and was very nearly angry with this household plague, who answered to the name of Edward; but the count, on the contrary, smiled, and appeared to look at the boy complacently, which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm.“But, madame,” replied the count, continuing the conversation, and looking by turns at Madame de Villefort and Valentine, “have I not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before?I could not help thinking so just now; the idea came over my mind, and as mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light thrown on a confused remembrance; excuse the remark.”“I do not think it likely, sir; Mademoiselle de Villefort is not very fond of society, and we very seldom go out,” said the young lady.“Then it was not in society that I met with mademoiselle or yourself, madame, or this charming little merry boy.Besides, the Parisian world is entirely unknown to me, for, as I believe I told you, I have been in Paris but very few days.No,—but, perhaps, you will permit me to call to mind—stay!”The Count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts.“No—it was somewhere—away from here—it was—I do not know—but it appears that this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some religious fête; mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand, the interesting boy was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden, and you, madame, were under the trellis of some arbor.Pray come to my aid, madame; do not these circumstances appeal to your memory?”“No, indeed,” replied Madame de Villefort; “and yet it appears to me, sir, that if I had met you anywhere, the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory.”“Perhaps the count saw us in Italy,” said Valentine timidly.“Yes, in Italy; it was in Italy most probably,” replied Monte Cristo; “you have travelled then in Italy, mademoiselle?”“Yes; madame and I were there two years ago.The doctors, anxious for my lungs, had prescribed the air of Naples.We went by Bologna, Perugia, and Rome.”“Ah, yes—true, mademoiselle,” exclaimed Monte Cristo as if this simple explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought. “It was at Perugia on Corpus Christi Day, in the garden of the Hôtel des Postes, when chance brought us together; you, Madame de Villefort, and her son; I now remember having had the honor of meeting you.”“I perfectly well remember Perugia, sir, and the Hôtel des Postes, and the festival of which you speak,” said Madame de Villefort, “but in vain do I tax my memory, of whose treachery I am ashamed, for I really do not recall to mind that I ever had the pleasure of seeing you before.”“It is strange, but neither do I recollect meeting with you,” observed Valentine, raising her beautiful eyes to the count.30065m   “But I remember it perfectly,” interposed the darling Edward.“I will assist your memory, madame,” continued the count; “the day had been burning hot; you were waiting for horses, which were delayed in consequence of the festival.Mademoiselle was walking in the shade of the garden, and your son disappeared in pursuit of the peacock.”“And I caught it, mamma, don’t you remember?”interposed Edward, “and I pulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail.”",

    "history": "From time to time chills ran through his whole body, and clutched his heart in a grasp of ice.Then he thought he was going to die.Yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance, and Dantès knew that he had escaped the first peril.It was a good augury.At length, about the hour the governor had appointed, footsteps were heard on the stairs.Edmond felt that the moment had arrived, summoned up all his courage, held his breath, and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins.The footsteps—they were double—paused at the door—and Dantès guessed that the two grave-diggers had come to seek him—this idea was soon converted into certainty, when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand-bier.The door opened, and a dim light reached Dantès’ eyes through the coarse sack that covered him; he saw two shadows approach his bed, a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand.The two men, approaching the ends of the bed, took the sack by its extremities.“He’s heavy, though, for an old and thin man,” said one, as he raised the head.“They say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones,” said another, lifting the feet.“Have you tied the knot?”inquired the first speaker.“What would be the use of carrying so much more weight?”was the reply, “I can do that when we get there.”“Yes, you’re right,” replied the companion.“What’s the knot for?”thought Dantès.They deposited the supposed corpse on the bier.Edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man, and then the party, lighted by the man with the torch, who went first, ascended the stairs.Suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air, and Dantès knew that the mistral was blowing.It was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled.The bearers went on for twenty paces, then stopped, putting the bier down on the ground.One of them went away, and Dantès heard his shoes striking on the pavement.“Where am I?”he asked himself.“Really, he is by no means a light load!”said the other bearer, sitting on the edge of the hand-barrow.Dantès’ first impulse was to escape, but fortunately he did not attempt it.“Give us a light,” said the other bearer, “or I shall never find what I am looking for.”The man with the torch complied, although not asked in the most polite terms.“What can he be looking for?”thought Edmond. “The spade, perhaps.”An exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the grave-digger had found the object of his search. “Here it is at last,” he said, “not without some trouble, though.”“Yes,” was the answer, “but it has lost nothing by waiting.”As he said this, the man came towards Edmond, who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him, and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence.“Well, have you tied the knot?”inquired the grave-digger, who was looking on.“Yes, and pretty tight too, I can tell you,” was the answer.“Move on, then.”And the bier was lifted once more, and they proceeded.They advanced fifty paces farther, and then stopped to open a door, then went forward again.The noise of the waves dashing against the rocks on which the château is built, reached Dantès’ ear distinctly as they went forward.“Bad weather!”observed one of the bearers; “not a pleasant night for a dip in the sea.”“Why, yes, the abbé runs a chance of being wet,” said the other; and then there was a burst of brutal laughter.Dantès did not comprehend the jest, but his hair stood erect on his head.“Well, here we are at last,” said one of them.“A little farther—a little farther,” said the other. “You know very well that the last was stopped on his way, dashed on the rocks, and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows.”They ascended five or six more steps, and then Dantès felt that they took him, one by the head and the other by the heels, and swung him to and fro.“One!”said the grave-diggers, “two!three!”And at the same instant Dantès felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird, falling, falling, with a rapidity that made his blood curdle.",

    "history": "This affair, like all those in which the Count of Monte Cristo had interfered, caused a great sensation in Paris.The proofs were certainly not convincing, since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galley-slave on his death- bed, and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion.But the mind of the procureur was made up; he felt assured that Benedetto was guilty, and he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his self-love, which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen heart.The case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of Villefort, who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes.He had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever, to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of trial.And then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor Valentine, and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent, that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties, which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief.Once only had Villefort seen his father; it was the day after that upon which Bertuccio had paid his second visit to Benedetto, when the latter was to learn his father’s name.The magistrate, harassed and fatigued, had descended to the garden of his house, and in a gloomy mood, similar to that in which Tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies, he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rose- trees, which, placed along the avenue, seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season.More than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure, always returning by the same path, to begin his walk again, at the same pace and with the same gesture, when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house, whence he heard the noisy play of his son, who had returned from school to spend the Sunday and Monday with his mother.While doing so, he observed M. Noirtier at one of the open windows, where the old man had been placed that he might enjoy the last rays of the sun which yet yielded some heat, and was now shining upon the dying flowers and red leaves of the creeper which twined around the balcony.The eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which Villefort could scarcely distinguish.His glance was so full of hate, of ferocity, and savage impatience, that Villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing, to see upon what person this dark look was directed.Then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden-trees, which were nearly divested of foliage, Madame de Villefort sitting with a book in her hand, the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son, or to throw back his elastic ball, which he obstinately threw from the drawing-room into the garden.Villefort became pale; he understood the old man’s meaning.Noirtier continued to look at the same object, but suddenly his glance was transferred from the wife to the husband, and Villefort himself had to submit to the searching investigation of eyes, which, while changing their direction and even their language, had lost none of their menacing expression.Madame de Villefort, unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head, at that moment held her son’s ball, and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss.Edward begged for a long while, the maternal kiss probably not offering sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it; however at length he decided, leaped out of the window into a cluster of heliotropes and daisies, and ran to his mother, his forehead streaming with perspiration.Madame de Villefort wiped his forehead, pressed her lips upon it, and sent him back with the ball in one hand and some bonbons in the other.Villefort, drawn by an irresistible attraction, like that of the bird to the serpent, walked towards the house.As he approached it, Noirtier’s gaze followed him, and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that Villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart.In that earnest look might be read a deep reproach, as well as a terrible menace.Then Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven, as though to remind his son of a forgotten oath.“It is well, sir,” replied Villefort from below,—“it is well; have patience but one day longer; what I have said I will do.”Noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words, and turned his eyes with indifference to the other side.Villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat, which seemed to strangle him, and passing his livid hand across his forehead, entered his study.The night was cold and still; the family had all retired to rest but Villefort, who alone remained up, and worked till five o’clock in the morning, reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by the examining magistrates, compiling the depositions of the",

    "history": "Sometimes, as Hamlet says:  ‘Foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes;’ but, like a phosphoric light, they rise but to mislead.The story has been told by the Corsican to some priest, who in his turn has repeated it.M. de Monte Cristo may have heard it, and to enlighten himself——  “But why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject?”asked Villefort, after a moment’s reflection, “what interest can this M. de Monte Cristo or M. Zaccone,—son of a shipowner of Malta, discoverer of a mine in Thessaly, now visiting Paris for the first time,—what interest, I say, can he take in discovering a gloomy, mysterious, and useless fact like this?However, among all the incoherent details given to me by the Abbé Busoni and by Lord Wilmore, by that friend and that enemy, one thing appears certain and clear in my opinion—that in no period, in no case, in no circumstance, could there have been any contact between him and me.”But Villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe.He dreaded not so much the revelation, for he could reply to or deny its truth;—he cared little for that mene, mene, tekel upharsin, which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall;—but what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them.While he was endeavoring to calm his fears,—and instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams, was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home, in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept,—the noise of a carriage sounded in the yard, then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs, followed by tears and lamentations, such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their master’s grief.He drew back the bolt of his door, and almost directly an old lady entered, unannounced, carrying her shawl on her arm, and her bonnet in her hand.The white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead, and her eyes, already sunken by the furrows of age, now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief.“Oh, sir,” she said; “oh, sir, what a misfortune!I shall die of it; oh, yes, I shall certainly die of it!”And then, falling upon the chair nearest the door, she burst into a paroxysm of sobs.The servants, standing in the doorway, not daring to approach nearer, were looking at Noirtier’s old servant, who had heard the noise from his master’s room, and run there also, remaining behind the others.Villefort rose, and ran towards his mother-in-law, for it was she.“Why, what can have happened?”he exclaimed, “what has thus disturbed you?Is M. de Saint-Méran with you?”“M. de Saint-Méran is dead,” answered the old marchioness, without preface and without expression; she appeared to be stupefied.Villefort drew back, and clasping his hands together, exclaimed:  “Dead!—so suddenly?”“A week ago,” continued Madame de Saint-Méran, “we went out together in the carriage after dinner.M. de Saint-Méran had been unwell for some days; still, the idea of seeing our dear Valentine again inspired him with courage, and notwithstanding his illness he would leave.At six leagues from Marseilles, after having eaten some of the lozenges he is accustomed to take, he fell into such a deep sleep, that it appeared to me unnatural; still I hesitated to wake him, although I fancied that his face was flushed, and that the veins of his temples throbbed more violently than usual.However, as it became dark, and I could no longer see, I fell asleep; I was soon aroused by a piercing shriek, as from a person suffering in his dreams, and he suddenly threw his head back violently.I called the valet, I stopped the postilion, I spoke to M. de Saint-Méran, I applied my smelling-salts; but all was over, and I arrived at Aix by the side of a corpse.”Villefort stood with his mouth half open, quite stupefied.“Of course you sent for a doctor?”“Immediately; but, as I have told you, it was too late.”“Yes; but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died.”“Oh, yes, sir, he told me; it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke.”“And what did you do then?”",

Debray, and you fancied from his words that Don Carlos had returned to Spain.Well, I sold my shares, the news got out, and I no longer sold—I gave them away, next day I find the news was false, and by this false report I have lost 700,000 francs.”“Well?”“Well, since I gave you a fourth of my gains, I think you owe me a fourth of my losses; the fourth of 700,000 francs is 175,000 francs.”“What you say is absurd, and I cannot see why M.

Morrel, at his death, left 500,000 francs, which were divided between my sister and myself, for we were his only children.Her husband, who, when he married her, had no other patrimony than his noble probity, his first-rate ability, and his spotless reputation, wished to possess as much as his wife.He labored and toiled until he had amassed 250,000 francs; six years sufficed to achieve this object.Oh, I assure you, sir, it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures, destined by their talents for higher stations, toiling together, and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal house, taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous people would have effected in two or three.Marseilles resounded with their well-earned praises.At last, one day, Emmanuel came to his wife, who had just finished making up the accounts.“‘Julie,’ said he to her, ‘Cocles has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred francs; that completes the 250,000 francs we had fixed as the limits of our gains.Can you content yourself with the small fortune which we shall possess for the future?Listen to me.Our house transacts business to the amount of a million a year, from which we derive an income of 40,000 francs.We can dispose of the business, if we please, in an hour, for I have received a letter from M. Delaunay, in which he offers to purchase the good-will of the house, to unite with his own, for 300,000 francs.Advise me what I had better do.’“‘Emmanuel,’ returned my sister, ‘the house of Morrel can only be carried on by a Morrel.Is it not worth 300,000 francs to save our father’s name from the chances of evil fortune and failure?’“‘I thought so,’ replied Emmanuel; ‘but I wished to have your advice.’“‘This is my counsel:—Our accounts are made up and our bills paid; all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more, and close our office.’“This was done instantly.It was three o’clock; at a quarter past, a merchant presented himself to insure two ships; it was a clear profit of 15,000 francs.“‘Monsieur,’ said Emmanuel, ‘have the goodness to address yourself to M. Delaunay.We have quitted business.’“‘How long?’inquired the astonished merchant.30043m   “‘A quarter of an hour,’ was the reply.“And this is the reason, monsieur,” continued Maximilian, “of my sister and brother-in-law having only 25,000 francs a year.”Maximilian had scarcely finished his story, during which the count’s heart had swelled within him, when Emmanuel entered wearing a hat and coat.He saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest; then, after having led Monte Cristo around the little garden, he returned to the house.A large vase of Japan porcelain, filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume, stood in the salon.Julie, suitably dressed, and her hair arranged (she had accomplished this feat in less than ten minutes), received the count on his entrance.The songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by, and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains.Everything in this charming retreat, from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress, breathed tranquillity and repose.The count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house, and he remained silent and pensive, forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation, which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged.The silence became almost painful when, by a violent effort, tearing himself from his pleasing reverie:  “Madame,” said he at length, “I pray you to excuse my emotion, which must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness I meet here; but contentment is so new a sight to me, that I could never be weary of looking at",

Noirtier may be right; you have not seemed to be well for the last fortnight.”“Not very,” said Valentine. “And grandpapa has become my physician, and I have the greatest confidence in him, because he knows everything.”“Do you then really suffer?”asked Morrel quickly.“Oh, it must not be called suffering; I feel a general uneasiness, that is all.I have lost my appetite, and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something.”Noirtier did not lose a word of what Valentine said.“And what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint?”“A very simple one,” said Valentine. “I swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather.When I say one spoonful, I began by one—now I take four.Grandpapa says it is a panacea.”Valentine smiled, but it was evident that she suffered.Maximilian, in his devotedness, gazed silently at her.She was very beautiful, but her usual pallor had increased; her eyes were more brilliant than ever, and her hands, which were generally white like mother-of-pearl, now more resembled wax, to which time was adding a yellowish hue.From Valentine the young man looked towards Noirtier.The latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl, absorbed by her affection, and he also, like Morrel, followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover.“But,” said Morrel, “I thought this mixture, of which you now take four spoonfuls, was prepared for M. Noirtier?”“I know it is very bitter,” said Valentine; “so bitter, that all I drink afterwards appears to have the same taste.”Noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter. “Yes, grandpapa,” said Valentine; “it is so.Just now, before I came down to you, I drank a glass of sugared water; I left half, because it seemed so bitter.”Noirtier turned pale, and made a sign that he wished to speak.Valentine rose to fetch the dictionary.Noirtier watched her with evident anguish.In fact, the blood was rushing to the young girl’s head already, her cheeks were becoming red.“Oh,” cried she, without losing any of her cheerfulness, “this is singular!I can’t see!Did the sun shine in my eyes?”And she leaned against the window.“The sun is not shining,” said Morrel, more alarmed by Noirtier’s expression than by Valentine’s indisposition.He ran towards her.The young girl smiled.“Cheer up,” said she to Noirtier. “Do not be alarmed, Maximilian; it is nothing, and has already passed away.But listen!Do I not hear a carriage in the courtyard?”She opened Noirtier’s door, ran to a window in the passage, and returned hastily. “Yes,” said she, “it is Madame Danglars and her daughter, who have come to call on us.Good-bye;—I must run away, for they would send here for me, or, rather, farewell till I see you again.Stay with grandpapa, Maximilian; I promise you not to persuade them to stay.”40274m   Morrel watched her as she left the room; he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to Madame de Villefort’s apartments and to hers.As soon as she was gone, Noirtier made a sign to Morrel to take the dictionary.Morrel obeyed; guided by Valentine, he had learned how to understand the old man quickly.Accustomed, however, as he was to the work, he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary, so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words,  “Fetch the glass of water and the decanter from Valentine’s room.”Morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken Barrois’s situation, and in Noirtier’s name gave that order.The servant soon returned.The decanter and the glass were completely empty.",

    "history": "Bertuccio alone turned pale whenever Benedetto’s name was mentioned in his presence, but there was no reason why anyone should notice his doing so.Villefort, being called on to prove the crime, was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases.But three weeks had already passed, and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful; the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars to the Count Andrea Cavalcanti.It was expected that this wedding would shortly take place, as the young man was received at the banker’s as the betrothed.Letters had been despatched to M. Cavalcanti, as the count’s father, who highly approved of the union, regretted his inability to leave Parma at that time, and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres.It was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to Danglars to invest; some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of his future father-in-law, who had of late sustained repeated losses; but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to listen, or to express a single doubt to the baron.The baron adored Count Andrea Cavalcanti; not so Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars.With an instinctive hatred of matrimony, she suffered Andrea’s attentions in order to get rid of Morcerf; but when Andrea urged his suit, she betrayed an entire dislike to him.The baron might possibly have perceived it, but, attributing it to a caprice, feigned ignorance.The delay demanded by Beauchamp had nearly expired.Morcerf appreciated the advice of Monte Cristo to let things die away of their own accord.No one had taken up the remark about the general, and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of Yanina the noble count in the House of Peers.Albert, however, felt no less insulted; the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult.Besides, the manner in which Beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart.He cherished the thought of the duel, hoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds.Beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited Albert, and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would detain him some days.Where he was no one knew.One morning Albert was awakened by his valet de chambre, who announced Beauchamp.Albert rubbed his eyes, ordered his servant to introduce him into the small smoking-room on the ground floor, dressed himself quickly, and went down.He found Beauchamp pacing the room; on perceiving him Beauchamp stopped.“Your arrival here, without waiting my visit at your house today, looks well, sir,” said Albert. “Tell me, may I shake hands with you, saying, ‘Beauchamp, acknowledge you have injured me, and retain my friendship,’ or must I simply propose to you a choice of arms?”“Albert,” said Beauchamp, with a look of sorrow which stupefied the young man, “let us first sit down and talk.”“Rather, sir, before we sit down, I must demand your answer.”“Albert,” said the journalist, “these are questions which it is difficult to answer.”“I will facilitate it by repeating the question, ‘Will you, or will you not, retract?’”“Morcerf, it is not enough to answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to questions which concern the honor, the social interest, and the life of such a man as Lieutenant-général the Count of Morcerf, peer of France.”“What must then be done?”40174m   “What I have done, Albert.I reasoned thus—money, time, and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family; probabilities will not suffice, only facts will justify a deadly combat with a friend.If I strike with the sword, or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom, for three years, I have been on terms of intimacy, I must, at least, know why I do so; I must meet him with a heart at ease, and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own arm must save his life.”“Well,” said Morcerf, impatiently, “what does all this mean?”“It means that I have just returned from Yanina.”“From Yanina?”“Yes.”“Impossible!”“Here is my passport; examine the visa—Geneva, Milan, Venice, Trieste, Delvino, Yanina.Will you believe the government of a republic, a kingdom, and an empire?”Albert cast his eyes on the passport, then raised them in astonishment to Beauchamp.“You have been to Yan",

Morrel, all the forms were got over; in a word I was, as I told you, at my marriage feast; and I should have been married in an hour, and tomorrow I intended to start for Paris, had I not been arrested on this charge which you as well as I now see to be unjust.”“Ah,” said Villefort, “this seems to me the truth.If you have been culpable, it was imprudence, and this imprudence was in obedience to the orders of your captain.Give up this letter you have brought from Elba, and pass your word you will appear should you be required, and go and rejoin your friends.“I am free, then, sir?”cried Dantès joyfully.“Yes; but first give me this letter.”“You have it already, for it was taken from me with some others which I see in that packet.”“Stop a moment,” said the deputy, as Dantès took his hat and gloves. “To whom is it addressed?”“To Monsieur Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, Paris.”Had a thunderbolt fallen into the room, Villefort could not have been more stupefied.He sank into his seat, and hastily turning over the packet, drew forth the fatal letter, at which he glanced with an expression of terror.“M.

Danglars, in the same tone in which he would have said, “Oh, well, what do I care?”“As a matter of fact,” said Monte Cristo, approaching, “I am much afraid that I am the involuntary cause of his absence.”“What, you, count?”said Madame Danglars, signing; “if you are, take care, for I shall never forgive you.”Andrea pricked up his ears.“But it is not my fault, as I shall endeavor to prove.”Everyone listened eagerly; Monte Cristo who so rarely opened his lips, was about to speak.“You remember,” said the count, during the most profound silence, “that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house; the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice, on attempting to leave it.”“Yes,” said Danglars.“In order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed, and his clothes were thrown into a corner, where the police picked them up, with the exception of the waistcoat, which they overlooked.”Andrea turned pale, and drew towards the door; he saw a cloud rising in the horizon, which appeared to forebode a coming storm.“Well, this waistcoat was discovered today, covered with blood, and with a hole over the heart.”The ladies screamed, and two or three prepared to faint. “It was brought to me.No one could guess what the dirty rag could be; I alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered man.My valet, in examining this mournful relic, felt a paper in the pocket and drew it out; it was a letter addressed to you, baron.”“To me?”cried Danglars.“Yes, indeed, to you; I succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained,” replied Monte Cristo, amid the general outburst of amazement.“But,” asked Madame Danglars, looking at her husband with uneasiness, “how could that prevent M. de Villefort——”  “In this simple way, madame,” replied Monte Cristo; “the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence; I therefore sent them to the king’s attorney.You understand, my dear baron, that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases; it was, perhaps, some plot against you.”Andrea looked steadily at Monte Cristo and disappeared in the second drawing-room.“Possibly,” said Danglars; “was not this murdered man an old galley- slave?”50025m   “Yes,” replied the count; “a felon named Caderousse.”Danglars turned slightly pale; Andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing- room.“But go on signing,” said Monte Cristo; “I perceive that my story has caused a general emotion, and I beg to apologize to you, baroness, and to Mademoiselle Danglars.”The baroness, who had signed, returned the pen to the notary.“Prince Cavalcanti,” said the latter; “Prince Cavalcanti, where are you?”“Andrea, Andrea,” repeated several young people, who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his Christian name.“Call the prince; inform him that it is his turn to sign,” cried Danglars to one of the floorkeepers.But at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments, quærens quem devoret.There was, indeed, reason to retreat, to be alarmed, and to scream.An officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawing-room, and was advancing towards Danglars, preceded by a commissary of police, girded with his scarf.Madame Danglars uttered a scream and fainted.Danglars, who thought himself threatened (certain consciences are never calm),—Danglars even before his guests showed a countenance of abject terror.“What is the matter, sir?”asked Monte Cristo, advancing to meet the commissioner.“Which of you gentlemen,” asked the magistrate, without replying to the count, “answers to the name of Andrea Cavalcanti?”A cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room.They searched; they questioned.",

Danglars, who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness, but without understanding a word, since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past, he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker.“There is, then, the second point cleared up, or nearly so,” said Eugénie, without the least confusion, and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language; “and you appear satisfied with the explanation.Now, let us return to the first.",

Andrea Cavalcanti.This formal announcement, which implied or appeared to imply, the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair, had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be admitted.We beg them to take one step backward, and to transport themselves, the morning of that day of great catastrophes, into the showy, gilded salon we have before shown them, and which was the pride of its owner, Baron Danglars.In this room, at about ten o’clock in the morning, the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness, watching both doors, and listening to every sound.When his patience was exhausted, he called his valet.“Étienne,” said he, “see why Mademoiselle Eugénie has asked me to meet her in the drawing-room, and why she makes me wait so long.”Having given this vent to his ill-humor, the baron became more calm; Mademoiselle Danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father, and had fixed on the gilded drawing-room as the spot.The singularity of this step, and above all its formality, had not a little surprised the banker, who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawing-room.Étienne soon returned from his errand.“Mademoiselle’s lady’s maid says, sir, that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette, and will be here shortly.”Danglars nodded, to signify that he was satisfied.To the world and to his servants Danglars assumed the character of the good-natured man and the indulgent father.This was one of his parts in the popular comedy he was performing,—a make-up he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors, who seen from one side, were the image of geniality, and from the other showed lips drawn down in chronic ill-temper.Let us hasten to say that in private the genial side descended to the level of the other, so that generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and domineering father.“Why the devil does that foolish girl, who pretends to wish to speak to me, not come into my study?and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all?”He was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time, when the door opened and Eugénie appeared, attired in a figured black satin dress, her hair dressed and gloves on, as if she were going to the Italian Opera.“Well, Eugénie, what is it you want with me?and why in this solemn drawing-room when the study is so comfortable?”“I quite understand why you ask, sir,” said Eugénie, making a sign that her father might be seated, “and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation.I will answer them both, and contrary to the usual method, the last first, because it is the least difficult.I have chosen the drawing-room, sir, as our place of meeting, in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a banker’s study.Those gilded cashbooks, drawers locked like gates of fortresses, heaps of bank-bills, come from I know not where, and the quantities of letters from England, Holland, Spain, India, China, and Peru, have generally a strange influence on a father’s mind, and make him forget that",

Thomson & French were your bankers.That happened, as I told you, in 1829.For God’s sake, tell me, did you know this Englishman?”“But you tell me, also, that the house of Thomson & French have constantly denied having rendered you this service?”“Yes.”“Then is it not probable that this Englishman may be someone who, grateful for a kindness your father had shown him, and which he himself had forgotten, has taken this method of requiting the obligation?”“Everything is possible in this affair, even a miracle.”“What was his name?”asked Monte Cristo.“He gave no other name,” answered Julie, looking earnestly at the count, “than that at the end of his letter—‘Sinbad the Sailor.’”“Which is evidently not his real name, but a fictitious one.”Then, noticing that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice:  “Tell me,” continued he, “was he not about my height, perhaps a little taller, with his chin imprisoned, as it were, in a high cravat; his coat closely buttoned up, and constantly taking out his pencil?”“Oh, do you then know him?”cried Julie, whose eyes sparkled with joy.“No,” returned Monte Cristo “I only guessed.I knew a Lord Wilmore, who was constantly doing actions of this kind.”“Without revealing himself?”“He was an eccentric being, and did not believe in the existence of gratitude.”“Oh, Heaven,” exclaimed Julie, clasping her hands, “in what did he believe, then?”30047m   “He did not credit it at the period which I knew him,” said Monte Cristo, touched to the heart by the accents of Julie’s voice; “but, perhaps, since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist.”“And do you know this gentleman, monsieur?”inquired Emmanuel.“Oh, if you do know him,” cried Julie, “can you tell us where he is—where we can find him?Maximilian—Emmanuel—if we do but discover him, he must believe in the gratitude of the heart!”Monte Cristo felt tears start into his eyes, and he again walked hastily up and down the room.“In the name of Heaven,” said Maximilian, “if you know anything of him, tell us what it is.”“Alas,” cried Monte Cristo, striving to repress his emotion, “if Lord Wilmore was your unknown benefactor, I fear you will never see him again.I parted from him two years ago at Palermo, and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions; so that I fear he will never return.”“Oh, monsieur, this is cruel of you,” said Julie, much affected; and the young lady’s eyes swam with tears.“Madame,” replied Monte Cristo gravely, and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down Julie’s cheeks, “had Lord Wilmore seen what I now see, he would become attached to life, for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind;” and he held out his hand to Julie, who gave him hers, carried away by the look and accent of the count.“But,” continued she, “Lord Wilmore had a family or friends, he must have known someone, can we not——”  “Oh, it is useless to inquire,” returned the count; “perhaps, after all, he was not the man you seek for.He was my friend: he had no secrets from me, and if this had been so he would have confided in me.”“And he told you nothing?”“Not a word.”“Nothing that would lead you to suppose?”“Nothing.”“And yet you spoke of him at once.”“Ah, in such a case one supposes——”  “Sister, sister,” said Maximilian, coming to the count’s aid, “monsieur is quite right.Recollect what our excellent father so often told us, ‘It was no Englishman that thus saved us.’�",

Danglars?”“Yes; M. Danglars is a money-lover, and those who love money, you know, think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel.The other is, on the contrary, to all appearance a true nobleman; but do you not fear to find him a bully?”“I only fear one thing; namely, to find a man who will not fight.”“Do not be alarmed,” said Beauchamp; “he will meet you.My only fear is that he will be too strong for you.”“My friend,” said Morcerf, with a sweet smile, “that is what I wish.The happiest thing that could occur to me, would be to die in my father’s stead; that would save us all.”“Your mother would die of grief.”“My poor mother!”said Albert, passing his hand across his eyes, “I know she would; but better so than die of shame.”“Are you quite decided, Albert?”“Yes; let us go.”“But do you think we shall find the count at home?”“He intended returning some hours after me, and doubtless he is now at home.”They ordered the driver to take them to No.30 Champs-Élysées.Beauchamp wished to go in alone, but Albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of duels.The cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that Beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes; he yielded and contented himself with following Morcerf.Albert sprang from the porter’s lodge to the steps.He was received by Baptistin.The count had, indeed, just arrived, but he was in his bath, and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted.“But after his bath?”asked Morcerf.“My master will go to dinner.”“And after dinner?”“He will sleep an hour.”“Then?”“He is going to the Opera.”“Are you sure of it?”asked Albert.“Quite, sir; my master has ordered his horses at eight o’clock precisely.”“Very good,” replied Albert; “that is all I wished to know.”Then, turning towards Beauchamp, “If you have anything to attend to, Beauchamp, do it directly; if you have any appointment for this evening, defer it till tomorrow.I depend on you to accompany me to the Opera; and if you can, bring Château-Renaud with you.”Beauchamp availed himself of Albert’s permission, and left him, promising to call for him at a quarter before eight.On his return home, Albert expressed his wish to Franz Debray, and Morrel, to see them at the Opera that evening.Then he went to see his mother, who since the events of the day before had refused to see anyone, and had kept her room.He found her in bed, overwhelmed with grief at this public humiliation.The sight of Albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on Mercédès; she pressed her son’s hand and sobbed aloud, but her tears relieved her.Albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mother’s bed.It was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker.“My dear mother,” said he, “do you know if M. de Morcerf has any enemy?”Mercédès started; she noticed that the young man did not say “my father.”“My son,” she said, “persons in the count’s situation have many secret enemies.Those who are known are not the most dangerous.”“I know it, and appeal to your penetration.You are of so superior a mind, nothing escapes you.”“Why do you say so?”“Because, for instance, you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave, that M. de Monte Cristo would eat",

Noirtier’s room; Morrel followed her on tiptoe; at the door they found the old servant.“Barrois,” said Valentine, “shut the door, and let no one come in.”She passed first.Noirtier, seated in his chair, and listening to every sound, was watching the door; he saw Valentine, and his eye brightened.There was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man, and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate.“Dear grandfather.”said she hurriedly, “you know poor grandmamma died an hour since, and now I have no friend in the world but you.”His expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness.“To you alone, then, may I confide my sorrows and my hopes?”The paralytic motioned “Yes.”Valentine took Maximilian’s hand.“Look attentively, then, at this gentleman.”The old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on Morrel.“It is M. Maximilian Morrel,” said she; “the son of that good merchant of Marseilles, whom you doubtless recollect.”“Yes,” said the old man.“He brings an irreproachable name, which Maximilian is likely to render glorious, since at thirty years of age he is a captain, an officer of the Legion of Honor.”The old man signified that he recollected him.“Well, grandpapa,” said Valentine, kneeling before him, and pointing to Maximilian, “I love him, and will be only his; were I compelled to marry another, I would destroy myself.”The eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts.“You like M. Maximilian Morrel, do you not, grandpapa?”asked Valentine.“Yes.”“And you will protect us, who are your children, against the will of my father?”Noirtier cast an intelligent glance at Morrel, as if to say, “perhaps I may.”Maximilian understood him.“Mademoiselle,” said he, “you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmother’s room, will you allow me the honor of a few minutes’ conversation with M.

Morrel, addressing the magistrate, whom he evidently knew; “there is doubtless some mistake easily explained.”“If it be so,” replied the magistrate, “rely upon every reparation being made; meanwhile, I am the bearer of an order of arrest, and although I most reluctantly perform the task assigned me, it must, nevertheless, be fulfilled.Who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of Edmond Dantès?”Every eye was turned towards the young man who, spite of the agitation he could not but feel, advanced with dignity, and said, in a firm voice:  “I am he; what is your pleasure with me?”“Edmond Dantès,” replied the magistrate, “I arrest you in the name of the law!”“Me!”repeated Edmond, slightly changing color, “and wherefore, I pray?”“I cannot inform you, but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination.”M. Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless.He saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law, and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf, as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy.Old Dantès, however, sprang forward.There are situations which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to understand.He prayed and supplicated in terms so moving, that even the officer was touched, and, although firm in his duty, he kindly said,",

    "history": "“There is a Providence; there is a God,” said Monte Cristo, “of whom you are a striking proof, as you lie in utter despair, denying him, while I stand before you, rich, happy, safe and entreating that God in whom you endeavor not to believe, while in your heart you still believe in him.”“But who are you, then?”asked Caderousse, fixing his dying eyes on the count.“Look well at me!”said Monte Cristo, putting the light near his face.“Well, the abbé—the Abbé Busoni.”Monte Cristo took off the wig which disfigured him, and let fall his black hair, which added so much to the beauty of his pallid features.“Oh?”said Caderousse, thunderstruck, “but for that black hair, I should say you were the Englishman, Lord Wilmore.”“I am neither the Abbé Busoni nor Lord Wilmore,” said Monte Cristo; “think again,—do you not recollect me?”There was a magic effect in the count’s words, which once more revived the exhausted powers of the miserable man.“Yes, indeed,” said he; “I think I have seen you and known you formerly.”“Yes, Caderousse, you have seen me; you knew me once.”“Who, then, are you?and why, if you knew me, do you let me die?”“Because nothing can save you; your wounds are mortal.Had it been possible to save you, I should have considered it another proof of God’s mercy, and I would again have endeavored to restore you, I swear by my father’s tomb.”“By your father’s tomb!”said Caderousse, supported by a supernatural power, and half-raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred; “who, then, are you?”The count had watched the approach of death.He knew this was the last struggle.He approached the dying man, and, leaning over him with a calm and melancholy look, he whispered, “I am—I am——”  And his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to hear it.Caderousse, who had raised himself on his knees, and stretched out his arm, tried to draw back, then clasping his hands, and raising them with a desperate effort, “Oh, my God, my God!”said he, “pardon me for having denied thee; thou dost exist, thou art indeed man’s father in heaven, and his judge on earth.My God, my Lord, I have long despised thee!Pardon me, my God; receive me, Oh, my Lord!”Caderousse sighed deeply, and fell back with a groan.The blood no longer flowed from his wounds.He was dead.“One!”said the count mysteriously, his eyes fixed on the corpse, disfigured by so awful a death.Ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived, the one accompanied by the porter, the other by Ali, and were received by the Abbé Busoni, who was praying by the side of the corpse.Chapter 84.Beauchamp  The daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout Paris for the next fortnight.The dying man had signed a deposition declaring Benedetto to be the assassin.The police had orders to make the strictest search for the murderer.Caderousse’s knife, dark lantern, bunch of keys, and clothing, excepting the waistcoat, which could not be found, were deposited at the registry; the corpse was conveyed to the morgue.The count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at Auteuil, and that he only knew what was related by the Abbé Busoni, who that evening, by mere chance, had requested to pass the night in his house, to examine some valuable books in his library.Bertuccio alone turned pale whenever Benedetto’s name was mentioned in his presence, but there was no reason why anyone should notice his doing so.Villefort, being called on to prove the crime, was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases.But three weeks had already passed, and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful; the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars to the Count Andrea Cavalcanti.It was expected that this wedding would shortly take place, as the young man was received at the banker’s as the betrothed.Letters had been despatched to M. Cavalcanti, as the count’s father, who highly approved of the union, regretted his inability to leave Parma at that time, and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres.",

Franz d’Épinay.Did you say he was coming?”“Yes; summoned by M. de Villefort, who is apparently as anxious to get Mademoiselle Valentine married as M. Danglars is to see Mademoiselle Eugénie settled.It must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grown-up daughter; it seems to make one feverish, and to raise one’s pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done.”“But M. d’Épinay, unlike you, bears his misfortune patiently.”“Still more, he talks seriously about the matter, puts on a white tie, and speaks of his family.He entertains a very high opinion of M. and Madame de Villefort.”“Which they deserve, do they not?”“I believe they do.M. de Villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man.”“There is, then, one,” said Monte Cristo, “whom you do not condemn like poor Danglars?”“Because I am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps,” replied Albert, laughing.",

    "history": "“Fifty feet!”responded Dantès, almost terrified.“Do not speak so loud, young man—don’t speak so loud.It frequently occurs in a state prison like this, that persons are stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the prisoners.”“But they believe I am shut up alone here.”“That makes no difference.”“And you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get here?”“I do; that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine; only, unfortunately, I did not curve aright; for want of the necessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion, instead of taking an ellipsis of forty feet, I made it fifty.I expected, as I told you, to reach the outer wall, pierce through it, and throw myself into the sea; I have, however, kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens, instead of going beneath it.My labor is all in vain, for I find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers.”“That’s true,” said Dantès; “but the corridor you speak of only bounds one side of my cell; there are three others—do you know anything of their situation?”“This one is built against the solid rock, and it would take ten experienced miners, duly furnished with the requisite tools, as many years to perforate it.This adjoins the lower part of the governor’s apartments, and were we to work our way through, we should only get into some lock-up cellars, where we must necessarily be recaptured.The fourth and last side of your cell faces on—faces on—stop a minute, now where does it face?”The wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole by which light was admitted to the chamber.This loophole, which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside, to an opening through which a child could not have passed, was, for better security, furnished with three iron bars, so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner’s escape.As the stranger asked the question, he dragged the table beneath the window.“Climb up,” said he to Dantès.The young man obeyed, mounted on the table, and, divining the wishes of his companion, placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hands.The stranger, whom as yet Dantès knew only by the number of his cell, sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years, and, light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard, climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of Dantès, and from them to his shoulders; then, bending double, for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect, he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window, so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom.An instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head, saying, “I thought so!”and sliding from the shoulders of Dantès as dextrously as he had ascended, he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground.“What was it that you thought?”asked the young man anxiously, in his turn descending from the table.The elder prisoner pondered the matter. “Yes,” said he at length, “it is so.This side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery, where patrols are continually passing, and sentries keep watch day and night.”“Are you quite sure of that?”“Certain.I saw the soldier’s shape and the top of his musket; that made me draw in my head so quickly, for I was fearful he might also see me.”“Well?”inquired Dantès.“You perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon?”“Then——” pursued the young man eagerly.“Then,” answered the elder prisoner, “the will of God be done!”And as the old man slowly pronounced those words, an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance.Dantès gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration.“Tell me, I entreat of you, who and what you are?”said he at length.“Never have I met with so remarkable a person as yourself.”“Willingly,” answered the stranger; “if, indeed, you feel any curiosity respecting one, now, alas, powerless to aid you in any way.”“Say not so; you can console and support me by the strength of your own powerful mind.Pray let me know who you really are?”The stranger smiled a melancholy smile. “Then listen,” said he. “",

    "history": "“I do not think that, for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated, and asked why the Venetian blinds were not opened as well as the windows.”“In a word,” said Mercédès, “it was a way of assuring me that his abstinence was intended.”And she left the room.A minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open, and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns, and the supper laid under the tent.Dancers, players, talkers, all uttered an exclamation of joy—everyone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated in.At the same time Mercédès reappeared, paler than before, but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes wore.She went straight to the group of which her husband formed the centre.“Do not detain those gentlemen here, count,” she said; “they would prefer, I should think, to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here, since they are not playing.”“Ah,” said a gallant old general, who, in 1809, had sung Partant pour la Syrie,—“we will not go alone to the garden.”“Then,” said Mercédès, “I will lead the way.”Turning towards Monte Cristo, she added, “count, will you oblige me with your arm?”The count almost staggered at these simple words; then he fixed his eyes on Mercédès.It was only a momentary glance, but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century, so much was expressed in that one look.He offered his arm to the countess; she took it, or rather just touched it with her little hand, and they together descended the steps, lined with rhododendrons and camellias.Behind them, by another outlet, a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of delight.Chapter 71.Bread and Salt  Madame de Morcerf entered an archway of trees with her companion.It led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory.“It was too warm in the room, was it not, count?”she asked.“Yes, madame; and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds.”As he ceased speaking, the count felt the hand of Mercédès tremble. “But you,” he said, “with that light dress, and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf, perhaps you feel cold?”“Do you know where I am leading you?”said the countess, without replying to the question.“No, madame,” replied Monte Cristo; “but you see I make no resistance.”“We are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the grove.”The count looked at Mercédès as if to interrogate her, but she continued to walk on in silence, and he refrained from speaking.They reached the building, ornamented with magnificent fruits, which ripen at the beginning of July in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun, so frequently absent in our climate.The countess left the arm of Monte Cristo, and gathered a bunch of Muscatel grapes.“See, count,” she said, with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelids—“see, our French grapes are not to be compared, I know, with yours of Sicily and Cyprus, but you will make allowance for our northern sun.”The count bowed, but stepped back.“Do you refuse?”said Mercédès, in a tremulous voice.“Pray excuse me, madame,” replied Monte Cristo, “but I never eat Muscatel grapes.”Mercédès let them fall, and sighed.A magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall, ripened by the same artificial heat.Mercédès drew near, and plucked the fruit.“Take this peach, then,” she said.The count again refused. “What, again?”she exclaimed, in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob; “really, you pain me.”A long silence followed; the peach, like the grapes, fell to the ground.“Count,” added Mercédès with a supplicating glance, “there is a beautiful Arabian custom, which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof.”“I know it, madame,” replied the count; “but we are in France, and not in Arabia, and in France eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another.”",

    "history": "I love to see you thus.Now, then, were a conspirator to fall into your hands, he would be most welcome.”“For my part, dear mother,” interposed Renée, “I trust your wishes will not prosper, and that Providence will only permit petty offenders, poor debtors, and miserable cheats to fall into M. de Villefort’s hands,—then I shall be contented.”“Just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches, measles, and the stings of wasps, or any other slight affection of the epidermis.If you wish to see me the king’s attorney, you must desire for me some of those violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to the physician.”At this moment, and as though the utterance of Villefort’s wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment, a servant entered the room, and whispered a few words in his ear.Villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he soon, however, returned, his whole face beaming with delight.Renée regarded him with fond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover.“You were wishing just now,” said Villefort, addressing her, “that I were a doctor instead of a lawyer.Well, I at least resemble the disciples of Esculapius in one thing [people spoke in this style in 1815], that of not being able to call a day my own, not even that of my betrothal.”“And wherefore were you called away just now?”asked Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, with an air of deep interest.“For a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the executioner.”“How dreadful!”exclaimed Renée, turning pale.“Is it possible?”burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words.“Why, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered.”“Can I believe my ears?”cried the marquise.“I will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,” said Villefort:  “‘The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country, that one named Edmond Dantès, mate of the ship Pharaon, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper, and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris.Ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned Edmond Dantès, who either carries the letter for Paris about with him, or has it at his father’s abode.Should it not be found in the possession of father or son, then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said Dantès on board the Pharaon.’”“But,” said Renée, “this letter, which, after all, is but an anonymous scrawl, is not even addressed to you, but to the king’s attorney.”0093m   “True; but that gentleman being absent, his secretary, by his orders, opened his letters; thinking this one of importance, he sent for me, but not finding me, took upon himself to give the necessary orders for arresting the accused party.”“Then the guilty person is absolutely in custody?”said the marquise.“Nay, dear mother, say the accused person.You know we cannot yet pronounce him guilty.”“He is in safe custody,” answered Villefort; “and rely upon it, if the letter is found, he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again, unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman.”“And where is the unfortunate being?”asked Renée.“He is at my house.”“Come, come, my friend,” interrupted the marquise, “do not neglect your duty to linger with us.You are the king’s servant, and must go wherever that service calls you.”“Oh, Villefort!”cried Renée, clasping her hands, and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness, “be merciful on this the day of our betrothal.”The young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader sat, and leaning over her chair said tenderly:  “To give you pleasure, my sweet Renée, I promise to show all the lenity in my power; but if the charges brought against this Bonapartist hero prove correct, why, then,",

    "history": "This belief was changed into certainty when Franz saw the bouquet (conspicuous by a circle of white camellias) in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rose- satin.The evening was no longer joy, but delirium.Albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner.Franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him, and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal.Albert was not deceived, for the next evening Franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner.“Well,” said he, “was I mistaken?”“She has answered you!”cried Franz.“Read.”This word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe.Franz took the letter, and read:  “Tuesday evening, at seven o’clock, descend from your carriage opposite the Via dei Pontefici, and follow the Roman peasant who snatches your torch from you.When you arrive at the first step of the church of San Giacomo, be sure to fasten a knot of rose- ribbons to the shoulder of your harlequin costume, in order that you may be recognized.Until then you will not see me. —Constancy and Discretion.”“Well,” asked he, when Franz had finished, “what do you think of that?”“I think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance.”“I think so, also,” replied Albert; “and I very much fear you will go alone to the Duke of Bracciano’s ball.”Franz and Albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated Roman banker.“Take care, Albert,” said Franz. “All the nobility of Rome will be present, and if your fair incognita belong to the higher class of society, she must go there.”“Whether she goes there or not, my opinion is still the same,” returned Albert. “You have read the letter?”“Yes.”“You know how imperfectly the women of the mezzo cito are educated in Italy?” (This is the name of the lower class.)“Yes.”“Well, read the letter again.Look at the writing, and find if you can, any blemish in the language or orthography.”The writing was, in reality, charming, and the orthography irreproachable.“You are born to good fortune,” said Franz, as he returned the letter.“Laugh as much as you will,” replied Albert, “I am in love.”“You alarm me,” cried Franz. “I see that I shall not only go alone to the Duke of Bracciano’s, but also return to Florence alone.”“If my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful,” said Albert, “I shall fix myself at Rome for six weeks, at least.I adore Rome, and I have always had a great taste for archæology.”20189m   “Come, two or three more such adventures, and I do not despair of seeing you a member of the Academy.”Doubtless Albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready.Albert’s love had not taken away his appetite.He hastened with Franz to seat himself, free to recommence the discussion after dinner.After dinner, the Count of Monte Cristo was announced.They had not seen him for two days.Signor Pastrini informed them that business had called him to Civita Vecchia.He had started the previous evening, and had only returned an hour since.He was charming.Whether he kept a watch over himself, or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched, he was tonight like everybody else.The man was an enigma to Franz.The count must feel sure that Franz recognized him; and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them.On his side, however great Franz’s desire was to allude to their former interview, the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it.The count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the Argentina Theatre, and were told they were all let.In consequence, he brought them the key of his own—at least such was the apparent motive of his visit.Franz and Albert made some difficulty, alleging their fear of depriving him of it; but the count replied that, as he was going to the Palli Theatre, the box at the Argentina Theatre would be lost if they did not profit by it.This assurance determined the two friends to accept it.Franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count’s pallor, which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting.He could not refrain from admiring the severe beauty of his features, the only defect, or rather the principal quality of which was the pallor.Truly,",

    "history": "The floor of the abbé’s cell was paved, and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that Faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which Dantès had witnessed the completion.As he entered the chamber of his friend, Dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels, but nothing more than common met his view.“It is well,” said the abbé; “we have some hours before us—it is now just a quarter past twelve o’clock.”Instinctively Dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour.“Look at this ray of light which enters by my window,” said the abbé, “and then observe the lines traced on the wall.Well, by means of these lines, which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth, and the ellipse it describes round the sun, I am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if I possessed a watch; for that might be broken or deranged in its movements, while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths.”This last explanation was wholly lost upon Dantès, who had always imagined, from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the Mediterranean, that it moved, and not the earth.A double movement of the globe he inhabited, and of which he could feel nothing, appeared to him perfectly impossible.Each word that fell from his companion’s lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science, as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of Guzerat and Golconda, which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth.“Come,” said he to the abbé, “I am anxious to see your treasures.”The abbé smiled, and, proceeding to the disused fireplace, raised, by the help of his chisel, a long stone, which had doubtless been the hearth, beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth, serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to Dantès.0213m   “What do you wish to see first?”asked the abbé.“Oh, your great work on the monarchy of Italy!”Faria then drew forth from his hiding-place three or four rolls of linen, laid one over the other, like folds of papyrus.These rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long; they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing, so legible that Dantès could easily read it, as well as make out the sense—it being in Italian, a language he, as a Provençal, perfectly understood.“There,” said he, “there is the work complete.I wrote the word finis at the end of the sixty-eighth strip about a week ago.I have torn up two of my shirts, and as many handkerchiefs as I was master of, to complete the precious pages.Should I ever get out of prison and find in all Italy a printer courageous enough to publish what I have composed, my literary reputation is forever secured.”“I see,” answered Dantès. “Now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work.”“Look!”said Faria, showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long, and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting-brush, to the end of which was tied, by a piece of thread, one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to Dantès; it was pointed, and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen.Dantès examined it with intense admiration, then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form.“Ah, yes,” said Faria; “the penknife.That’s my masterpiece.I made it, as well as this larger knife, out of an old iron candlestick.”The penknife was sharp and keen as a razor; as for the other knife, it would serve a double purpose, and with it one could cut and thrust.Dantès examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at Marseilles as the works of the savages in the South Seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels.“As for the ink,” said Faria, “I told you how I managed to obtain that—and I only just make it from time to time, as I require it.”“One thing still puzzles me,” observed Dantès, “and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight?”",

Danglars, who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness, but without understanding a word, since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past, he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker.“There is, then, the second point cleared up, or nearly so,” said Eugénie, without the least confusion, and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language; “and you appear satisfied with the explanation.Now, let us return to the first.You ask me why I have requested this interview; I will tell you in two words, sir; I will not marry count Andrea Cavalcanti.”Danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven.40298m   “Yes, indeed, sir,” continued Eugénie, still quite calm; “you are astonished, I see; for since this little affair began, I have not manifested the slightest opposition, and yet I am always sure, when the opportunity arrives, to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me, and things which displease me.However, this time, my tranquillity, or passiveness as philosophers say, proceeded from another source; it proceeded from a wish, like a submissive and devoted daughter” (a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl), “to practice obedience.”“Well?”asked Danglars.“Well, sir,” replied Eugénie, “I have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come, I feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible.”“But,” said Danglars, whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic, marking evident premeditation and force of will, “what is your reason for this refusal, Eugénie?what reason do you assign?”“My reason?”replied the young girl. “Well, it is not that the man is more ugly, more foolish, or more disagreeable than any other; no, M. Andrea Cavalcanti may appear to those who look at men’s faces and figures as a very good specimen of his kind.It is not, either, that my heart is less touched by him than any other; that would be a schoolgirl’s reason, which I consider quite beneath me.I actually love no one, sir; you know it, do you not?I do not then see why, without real necessity, I should encumber my life with a perpetual companion.Has not some sage said, ‘Nothing too much’?and another, ‘I carry all my effects with me’?I have been taught these two aphorisms in Latin and in Greek; one is, I believe, from Phædrus, and the other from Bias.",

Danglars served together in Spain, my father in the army and M. Danglars in the commissariat department.It was there that my father, ruined by the revolution, and M. Danglars, who never had possessed any patrimony, both laid the foundations of their different fortunes.”“Yes,” said Monte Cristo “I think M. Danglars mentioned that in a visit which I paid him; and,” continued he, casting a side-glance at Lucien, who was turning over the leaves of an album, “Mademoiselle Eugénie is pretty—I think I remember that to be her name.”“Very pretty, or rather, very beautiful,” replied Albert, “but of that style of beauty which I do not appreciate; I am an ungrateful fellow.”“You speak as if you were already her husband.”“Ah,” returned Albert, in his turn looking around to see what Lucien was doing.“Really,” said Monte Cristo, lowering his voice, “you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage.”“Mademoiselle Danglars is too rich for me,” replied Morcerf, “and that frightens me.”“Bah,” exclaimed Monte Cristo, “that’s a fine reason to give.Are you not rich yourself?”“My father’s income is about 50,000 francs per annum; and he will give me, perhaps, ten or twelve thousand when I marry.”“That, perhaps, might not be considered a large sum, in Paris especially,” said the count; “but everything does not depend on wealth, and it is a fine thing to have a good name, and to occupy a high station in society.Your name is celebrated, your position magnificent; and then the Comte de Morcerf is a soldier, and it is pleasing to see the integrity of a Bayard united to the poverty of a Duguesclin; disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine.As for me, I consider the union with Mademoiselle Danglars a most suitable one; she will enrich you, and you will ennoble her.”Albert shook his head, and looked thoughtful.“There is still something else,” said he.“I confess,” observed Monte Cristo, “that I have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and beautiful.”“Oh,” said Morcerf, “this repugnance, if repugnance it may be called, is not all on my side.”“Whence can it arise, then?for you told me your father desired the marriage.”“It is my mother who dissents; she has a clear and penetrating judgment, and does not smile on the proposed union.I cannot account for it, but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the Danglars.”30107m   “Ah,” said the count, in a somewhat forced tone, “that may be easily explained; the Comtesse de Morcerf, who is aristocracy and refinement itself, does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth;",

Noirtier wishes to see you tonight, he said, in an undertone.“Tell him I will come when I leave my dear grandmamma,” she replied, feeling, with true delicacy, that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was Madame de Saint-Méran.Valentine found her grandmother in bed; silent caresses, heartwrung sobs, broken sighs, burning tears, were all that passed in this sad interview, while Madame de Villefort, leaning on her husband’s arm, maintained all outward forms of respect, at least towards the poor widow.She soon whispered to her husband:  “I think it would be better for me to retire, with your permission, for the sight of me appears still to afflict your mother-in-law.”Madame de Saint-Méran heard her.“Yes, yes,” she said softly to Valentine, “let her leave; but do you stay.”Madame de Villefort left, and Valentine remained alone beside the bed, for the procureur, overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death, had followed his wife.Meanwhile, Barrois had returned for the first time to old Noirtier, who having heard the noise in the house, had, as we have said, sent his old servant to inquire the cause; on his return, his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger.“Alas, sir,” exclaimed Barrois, “a great misfortune has happened.Madame de Saint-Méran has arrived, and her husband is dead!”M. de Saint-Méran and Noirtier had never been on strict terms of friendship; still, the death of one old man always considerably affects another.",

Demoustier says, and I will not <DW44> its course, or disturb its calm.My clerks are honest men, who earn my fortune, whom I pay much below their deserts, if I may value them according to what they bring in; therefore I shall not get into a passion with them; those with whom I will be in a passion are those who eat my dinners, mount my horses, and exhaust my fortune.”“And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune?Explain yourself more clearly, I beg, sir.”“Oh, make yourself easy!—I am not speaking riddles, and you will soon know what I mean.The people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out 700,000 francs in the course of an hour.”“I do not understand you, sir,” said the baroness, trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face.“You understand me perfectly, on the contrary,” said Danglars: “but, if you will persist, I will tell you that I have just lost 700,000 francs upon the Spanish loan.”“And pray,” asked the baroness, “am I responsible for this loss?”“Why not?”“Is it my fault you have lost 700,000 francs?”“Certainly it is not mine.”“Once for all, sir,” replied the baroness sharply, “I tell you I will not hear cash named; it is a style of language I never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband.”“Oh, I can well believe that, for neither of them was worth a penny.”“The better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank, which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night; that noise of jingling crowns, which are constantly being counted and re-counted, is odious to me.I only know one thing I dislike more, which is the sound of your voice.”“Really?”said Danglars. “Well, this surprises me, for I thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs!”30243m   “I?What could put such an idea into your head?”“Yourself.”“Ah?—what next?”“Most assuredly.”“I should like to know upon what occasion?”“Oh, mon Dieu!that is very easily done.Last February you were the first who told me of the Haitian funds.You had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at Le Havre, that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made.I know how clear-sighted your dreams are; I therefore purchased immediately as many shares as I could of the Haitian debt, and I gained 400,000 francs by it, of which 100,000 have been honestly paid to you.You spent it as you pleased; that was your business.In March there was a question about a grant to a railway.Three companies presented themselves, each offering equal securities.You told me that your instinct,—and although you pretend to know nothing about speculations, I think on the contrary, that your comprehension is very clear upon certain affairs,—well, you told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given to the company called the Southern.I bought two thirds of the shares of that company; as you had foreseen, the shares trebled in value, and I picked up a million, from which 250,000 francs were paid to you for pin- money.How have you spent this 250,000 francs?—it is no business of mine.”“When are you coming to the point?”cried the baroness, shivering with anger and impatience.“Patience, madame, I am coming to it.”“That’s fortunate.”“In April you went to dine at the minister’s.You heard a private conversation respecting Spanish affairs—on the expulsion of Don Carlos.I bought some Spanish shares",

    "history": "He found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power, and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy.Fear, that relentless pursuer, clogged Dantès’ efforts.He listened for any sound that might be audible, and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon, and strove to penetrate the darkness.He fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat, and he redoubled his exertions, increasing rapidly his distance from the château, but exhausting his strength.He swam on still, and already the terrible château had disappeared in the darkness.He could not see it, but he felt its presence.An hour passed, during which Dantès, excited by the feeling of freedom, continued to cleave the waves.“Let us see,” said he, “I have swum above an hour, but as the wind is against me, that has retarded my speed; however, if I am not mistaken, I must be close to Tiboulen.But what if I were mistaken?”A shudder passed over him.He sought to tread water, in order to rest himself; but the sea was too violent, and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation.“Well,” said he, “I will swim on until I am worn out, or the cramp seizes me, and then I shall sink;” and he struck out with the energy of despair.Suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense, and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him; at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee.He fancied for a moment that he had been shot, and listened for the report; but he heard nothing.Then he put out his hand, and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore.Before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks, that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent combustion.It was the Island of Tiboulen.Dantès rose, advanced a few steps, and, with a fervent prayer of gratitude, stretched himself on the granite, which seemed to him softer than down.Then, in spite of the wind and rain, he fell into the deep, sweet sleep of utter exhaustion.At the expiration of an hour Edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder.The tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings; from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent, lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves.Dantès had not been deceived—he had reached the first of the two islands, which was, in fact, Tiboulen.He knew that it was barren and without shelter; but when the sea became more calm, he resolved to plunge into its waves again, and swim to Lemaire, equally arid, but larger, and consequently better adapted for concealment.An overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter, and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury.Edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay; the waves, dashing themselves against it, wetted him with their spray.He was safely sheltered, and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning.It seemed to him that the island trembled to its base, and that it would, like a vessel at anchor, break moorings, and bear him off into the centre of the storm.He then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four-and-twenty hours.He extended his hands, and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock.As he rose, a flash of lightning, that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven, illumined the darkness.By its light, between the Island of Lemaire and Cape Croiselle, a quarter of a league distant, Dantès saw a fishing-boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves.A second after, he saw it again, approaching with frightful rapidity.Dantès cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger, but they saw it themselves.Another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging, while a fifth clung to the broken rudder.The men he beheld saw him undoubtedly, for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind.Above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving; suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way, and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea-bird.At the same moment a violent crash was heard, and cries of distress.Dantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel, and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors.Then all was dark again.Dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces; he listened, he groped about, but he heard and saw nothing—the cries had ceased, and the tempest continued to rage.",

Morrel’s salon.It was then that he encountered for the first time Villefort’s look,—that look peculiar to the magistrate, who, while seeming to read the thoughts of others, betrays nothing of his own.“Who and what are you?”demanded Villefort, turning over a pile of papers, containing information relative to the prisoner, that a police agent had given to him on his entry, and that, already, in an hour’s time, had swelled to voluminous proportions, thanks to the corrupt espionage of which “the accused” is always made the victim.“My name is Edmond Dantès,” replied the young man calmly; “I am mate of the Pharaon, belonging to Messrs. Morrel & Son.”“Your age?”continued Villefort.“Nineteen,” returned Dantès.“What were you doing at the moment you were arrested?”“I was at the festival of my marriage, monsieur,” said the young man, his voice slightly tremulous, so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing; so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of M. de Villefort and the radiant face of Mercédès.“You were at the festival of your marriage?”said the deputy, shuddering in spite of himself.“Yes, monsieur; I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have been attached to for three years.”Villefort, impassive as he was, was struck with this coincidence; and the tremulous voice of Dantès, surprised in the midst of his happiness, struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom—he also was on the point of being married, and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another. “This philosophic reflection,” thought he, “will make a great sensation at M. de Saint- Méran’s;” and he arranged mentally, while Dantès awaited further questions, the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence.When this speech was arranged, Villefort turned to Dantès.0099m   “Go on, sir,” said he.“What would you have me say?”“Give all the information in your power.”“Tell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all I know; only,” added he, with a smile, “I warn you I know very little.”“Have you served under the usurper?”“I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell.”“It is reported your political opinions are extreme,” said Villefort, who had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make this inquiry, as if it were an accusation.“My political opinions!”replied Dantès. “Alas, sir, I never had any opinions.I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no part to play.If I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe it to M. Morrel.Thus all my opinions—I will not say public, but private—are confined to these three sentiments,—I love my father, I respect M.

    "history": "No sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed, arranged his couch to the best of his power, ate little and slept less, and found existence almost supportable, because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure, like a worn-out garment.Two methods of self-destruction were at his disposal.He could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars, or refuse food and die of starvation.But the first was repugnant to him.Dantès had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates, who are hung up to the yard-arm; he would not die by what seemed an infamous death.He resolved to adopt the second, and began that day to carry out his resolve.0185m   Nearly four years had passed away; at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of time.Dantès said, “I wish to die,” and had chosen the manner of his death, and fearful of changing his mind, he had taken an oath to die. “When my morning and evening meals are brought,” thought he, “I will cast them out of the window, and they will think that I have eaten them.”He kept his word; twice a day he cast out, through the barred aperture, the provisions his jailer brought him—at first gayly, then with deliberation, and at last with regret.Nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed.Hunger made viands once repugnant, now acceptable; he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time, and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat, of tainted fish, of black and mouldy bread.It was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair; then his dungeon seemed less sombre, his prospects less desperate.He was still young—he was only four or five-and-twenty—he had nearly fifty years to live.What unforseen events might not open his prison door, and restore him to liberty?Then he raised to his lips the repast that, like a voluntary Tantalus, he refused himself; but he thought of his oath, and he would not break it.He persisted until, at last, he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole.The next morning he could not see or hear; the jailer feared he was dangerously ill.Edmond hoped he was dying.Thus the day passed away.Edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content; the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased; his thirst had abated; when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will-o’-the-wisps that play about the marshes.It was the twilight of that mysterious country called Death!Suddenly, about nine o’clock in the evening, Edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying.So many loathsome animals inhabited the prison, that their noise did not, in general, awake him; but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties, or whether the noise was really louder than usual, Edmond raised his head and listened.It was a continual scratching, as if made by a huge claw, a powerful tooth, or some iron instrument attacking the stones.Although weakened, the young man’s brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisoners—liberty!It seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him, and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the abyss.Perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him, and striving to diminish the distance that separated them.No, no, doubtless he was deceived, and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death!Edmond still heard the sound.It lasted nearly three hours; he then heard a noise of something falling, and all was silent.Some hours afterwards it began again, nearer and more distinct.Edmond was intensely interested.Suddenly the jailer entered.For a week since he had resolved to die, and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose, Edmond had not spoken to the attendant, had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him, and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him; but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it, and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments.The jailer brought him his breakfast.Dantès raised himself up and began to talk about everything; about the bad quality of the food, about the coldness of his dungeon, grumbling and complaining, in order to have an excuse for speaking louder, and wearying the patience of his jailer, who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner.Fortunately, he fancied that Dantès was delirious; and placing the food on the rickety table, he withdrew.Edmond listened, and the sound became more and more distinct.“There can be no doubt about it,” thought he; “it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom.",

    "history": "Having given this vent to his ill-humor, the baron became more calm; Mademoiselle Danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father, and had fixed on the gilded drawing-room as the spot.The singularity of this step, and above all its formality, had not a little surprised the banker, who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawing-room.Étienne soon returned from his errand.“Mademoiselle’s lady’s maid says, sir, that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette, and will be here shortly.”Danglars nodded, to signify that he was satisfied.To the world and to his servants Danglars assumed the character of the good-natured man and the indulgent father.This was one of his parts in the popular comedy he was performing,—a make-up he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors, who seen from one side, were the image of geniality, and from the other showed lips drawn down in chronic ill-temper.Let us hasten to say that in private the genial side descended to the level of the other, so that generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and domineering father.“Why the devil does that foolish girl, who pretends to wish to speak to me, not come into my study?and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all?”He was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time, when the door opened and Eugénie appeared, attired in a figured black satin dress, her hair dressed and gloves on, as if she were going to the Italian Opera.“Well, Eugénie, what is it you want with me?and why in this solemn drawing-room when the study is so comfortable?”“I quite understand why you ask, sir,” said Eugénie, making a sign that her father might be seated, “and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation.I will answer them both, and contrary to the usual method, the last first, because it is the least difficult.I have chosen the drawing-room, sir, as our place of meeting, in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a banker’s study.Those gilded cashbooks, drawers locked like gates of fortresses, heaps of bank-bills, come from I know not where, and the quantities of letters from England, Holland, Spain, India, China, and Peru, have generally a strange influence on a father’s mind, and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents.I have, therefore, chosen this drawing-room, where you see, smiling and happy in their magnificent frames, your portrait, mine, my mother’s, and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastorals.I rely much on external impressions; perhaps, with regard to you, they are immaterial, but I should be no artist if I had not some fancies.”“Very well,” replied M. Danglars, who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness, but without understanding a word, since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past, he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker.“There is, then, the second point cleared up, or nearly so,” said Eugénie, without the least confusion, and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language; “and you appear satisfied with the explanation.Now, let us return to the first.You ask me why I have requested this interview; I will tell you in two words, sir; I will not marry count Andrea Cavalcanti.”Danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven.40298m   “Yes, indeed, sir,” continued Eugénie, still quite calm; “you are astonished, I see; for since this little affair began, I have not manifested the slightest opposition, and yet I am always sure, when the opportunity arrives, to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me, and things which displease me.However, this time, my tranquillity, or passiveness as philosophers say, proceeded from another source; it proceeded from a wish, like a submissive and devoted daughter” (a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl), “to practice obedience.”“Well?”asked Danglars.“Well, sir,” replied Eugénie, “I have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come, I feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible.”“But,” said Danglars, whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic, marking evident premeditation and force of will, “what is your reason for this refusal, Eugénie?",

    "history": "The evening was no longer joy, but delirium.Albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner.Franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him, and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal.Albert was not deceived, for the next evening Franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner.“Well,” said he, “was I mistaken?”“She has answered you!”cried Franz.“Read.”This word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe.Franz took the letter, and read:  “Tuesday evening, at seven o’clock, descend from your carriage opposite the Via dei Pontefici, and follow the Roman peasant who snatches your torch from you.When you arrive at the first step of the church of San Giacomo, be sure to fasten a knot of rose- ribbons to the shoulder of your harlequin costume, in order that you may be recognized.Until then you will not see me. —Constancy and Discretion.”“Well,” asked he, when Franz had finished, “what do you think of that?”“I think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance.”“I think so, also,” replied Albert; “and I very much fear you will go alone to the Duke of Bracciano’s ball.”Franz and Albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated Roman banker.“Take care, Albert,” said Franz. “All the nobility of Rome will be present, and if your fair incognita belong to the higher class of society, she must go there.”“Whether she goes there or not, my opinion is still the same,” returned Albert. “You have read the letter?”“Yes.”“You know how imperfectly the women of the mezzo cito are educated in Italy?” (This is the name of the lower class.)“Yes.”“Well, read the letter again.Look at the writing, and find if you can, any blemish in the language or orthography.”The writing was, in reality, charming, and the orthography irreproachable.“You are born to good fortune,” said Franz, as he returned the letter.“Laugh as much as you will,” replied Albert, “I am in love.”“You alarm me,” cried Franz. “I see that I shall not only go alone to the Duke of Bracciano’s, but also return to Florence alone.”“If my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful,” said Albert, “I shall fix myself at Rome for six weeks, at least.I adore Rome, and I have always had a great taste for archæology.”20189m   “Come, two or three more such adventures, and I do not despair of seeing you a member of the Academy.”Doubtless Albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready.Albert’s love had not taken away his appetite.He hastened with Franz to seat himself, free to recommence the discussion after dinner.After dinner, the Count of Monte Cristo was announced.They had not seen him for two days.Signor Pastrini informed them that business had called him to Civita Vecchia.He had started the previous evening, and had only returned an hour since.He was charming.Whether he kept a watch over himself, or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched, he was tonight like everybody else.The man was an enigma to Franz.The count must feel sure that Franz recognized him; and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them.On his side, however great Franz’s desire was to allude to their former interview, the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it.The count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the Argentina Theatre, and were told they were all let.In consequence, he brought them the key of his own—at least such was the apparent motive of his visit.Franz and Albert made some difficulty, alleging their fear of depriving him of it; but the count replied that, as he was going to the Palli Theatre, the box at the Argentina Theatre would be lost if they did not profit by it.This assurance determined the two friends to accept it.Franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count’s pallor, which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting.He could not refrain from admiring the severe beauty of his features, the only defect, or rather the principal quality of which was the pallor.Truly, a Byronic hero!Franz could not, we will not say see him, but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon Manfred’s shoulders, or beneath Lara’s",

    "history": "The floor of the abbé’s cell was paved, and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that Faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which Dantès had witnessed the completion.As he entered the chamber of his friend, Dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels, but nothing more than common met his view.“It is well,” said the abbé; “we have some hours before us—it is now just a quarter past twelve o’clock.”Instinctively Dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour.“Look at this ray of light which enters by my window,” said the abbé, “and then observe the lines traced on the wall.Well, by means of these lines, which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth, and the ellipse it describes round the sun, I am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if I possessed a watch; for that might be broken or deranged in its movements, while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths.”This last explanation was wholly lost upon Dantès, who had always imagined, from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the Mediterranean, that it moved, and not the earth.A double movement of the globe he inhabited, and of which he could feel nothing, appeared to him perfectly impossible.Each word that fell from his companion’s lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science, as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of Guzerat and Golconda, which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth.“Come,” said he to the abbé, “I am anxious to see your treasures.”The abbé smiled, and, proceeding to the disused fireplace, raised, by the help of his chisel, a long stone, which had doubtless been the hearth, beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth, serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to Dantès.0213m   “What do you wish to see first?”asked the abbé.“Oh, your great work on the monarchy of Italy!”Faria then drew forth from his hiding-place three or four rolls of linen, laid one over the other, like folds of papyrus.These rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long; they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing, so legible that Dantès could easily read it, as well as make out the sense—it being in Italian, a language he, as a Provençal, perfectly understood.“There,” said he, “there is the work complete.I wrote the word finis at the end of the sixty-eighth strip about a week ago.I have torn up two of my shirts, and as many handkerchiefs as I was master of, to complete the precious pages.Should I ever get out of prison and find in all Italy a printer courageous enough to publish what I have composed, my literary reputation is forever secured.”“I see,” answered Dantès. “Now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work.”“Look!”said Faria, showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long, and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting-brush, to the end of which was tied, by a piece of thread, one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to Dantès; it was pointed, and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen.Dantès examined it with intense admiration, then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form.“Ah, yes,” said Faria; “the penknife.That’s my masterpiece.I made it, as well as this larger knife, out of an old iron candlestick.”The penknife was sharp and keen as a razor; as for the other knife, it would serve a double purpose, and with it one could cut and thrust.Dantès examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at Marseilles as the works of the savages in the South Seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels.“As for the ink,” said Faria, “I told you how I managed to obtain that—and I only just make it from time to time, as I require it.”“One thing still puzzles me,” observed Dantès, “and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight?”",

Thomson & French were your bankers.That happened, as I told you, in 1829.For God’s sake, tell me, did you know this Englishman?”“But you tell me, also, that the house of Thomson & French have constantly denied having rendered you this service?”“Yes.”“Then is it not probable that this Englishman may be someone who, grateful for a kindness your father had shown him, and which he himself had forgotten, has taken this method of requiting the obligation?”“Everything is possible in this affair, even a miracle.”“What was his name?”asked Monte Cristo.“He gave no other name,” answered Julie, looking earnestly at the count, “than that at the end of his letter—‘Sinbad the Sailor.’”“Which is evidently not his real name, but a fictitious one.”Then, noticing that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice:  “Tell me,” continued he, “was he not about my height, perhaps a little taller, with his chin imprisoned, as it were, in a high cravat; his coat closely buttoned up, and constantly taking out his pencil?”“Oh, do you then know him?”cried Julie, whose eyes sparkled with joy.“No,” returned Monte Cristo “I only guessed.I knew a Lord Wilmore, who was constantly doing actions of this kind.”“Without revealing himself?”“He was an eccentric being, and did not believe in the existence of gratitude.”“Oh, Heaven,” exclaimed Julie, clasping her hands, “in what did he believe, then?”30047m   “He did not credit it at the period which I knew him,” said Monte Cristo, touched to the heart by the accents of Julie’s voice; “but, perhaps, since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist.”“And do you know this gentleman, monsieur?”inquired Emmanuel.“Oh, if you do know him,” cried Julie, “can you tell us where he is—where we can find him?Maximilian—Emmanuel—if we do but discover him, he must believe in the gratitude of the heart!”Monte Cristo felt tears start into his eyes, and he again walked hastily up and down the room.“In the name of Heaven,” said Maximilian, “if you know anything of him, tell us what it is.”“Alas,” cried Monte Cristo, striving to repress his emotion, “if Lord Wilmore was your unknown benefactor, I fear you will never see him again.I parted from him two years ago at Palermo, and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions; so that I fear he will never return.”“Oh, monsieur, this is cruel of you,” said Julie, much affected; and the young lady’s eyes swam with tears.“Madame,” replied Monte Cristo gravely, and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down Julie’s cheeks, “had Lord Wilmore seen what I now see, he would become attached to life, for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind;” and he held out his hand to Julie, who gave him hers, carried away by the look and accent of the count.“But,” continued she, “Lord Wilmore had a family or friends, he must have known someone, can we not——”  “Oh, it is useless to inquire,” returned the count; “perhaps, after all, he was not the man you seek for.",

    "history": "No; you do all this, not I.”  “Still it seems to me, that as you profit by it——”  Danglars shrugged his shoulders. “Foolish creature,” he exclaimed.“Women fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three intrigues without being the talk of Paris!But know that if you had even hidden your irregularities from your husband, who has but the commencement of the art—for generally husbands will not see—you would then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the women of the world.But it has not been so with me,—I see, and always have seen, during the last sixteen years.You may, perhaps, have hidden a thought; but not a step, not an action, not a fault, has escaped me, while you flattered yourself upon your address, and firmly believed you had deceived me.What has been the result?—that, thanks to my pretended ignorance, there is none of your friends, from M. de Villefort to M. Debray, who has not trembled before me.There is not one who has not treated me as the master of the house,—the only title I desire with respect to you; there is not one, in fact, who would have dared to speak of me as I have spoken of them this day.I will allow you to make me hateful, but I will prevent your rendering me ridiculous, and, above all, I forbid you to ruin me.”The baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of Villefort had been pronounced; but then she became pale, and, rising, as if touched by a spring, she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition; she then took two or three steps towards her husband, as though to tear the secret from him, of which he was ignorant, or which he withheld from some odious calculation,—odious, as all his calculations were.“M. de Villefort!—What do you mean?”“I mean that M. de Nargonne, your first husband, being neither a philosopher nor a banker, or perhaps being both, and seeing there was nothing to be got out of a king’s attorney, died of grief or anger at finding, after an absence of nine months, that you had been enceinte six.I am brutal,—I not only allow it, but boast of it; it is one of the reasons of my success in commercial business.Why did he kill himself instead of you?Because he had no cash to save.My life belongs to my cash.M. Debray has made me lose 700,000 francs; let him bear his share of the loss, and we will go on as before; if not, let him become bankrupt for the 250,000 livres, and do as all bankrupts do—disappear.He is a charming fellow, I allow, when his news is correct; but when it is not, there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he.”Madame Danglars was rooted to the spot; she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack, but she fell upon a chair thinking of Villefort, of the dinner scene, of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days, and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate.Danglars did not even look at her, though she did her best to faint.He shut the bedroom door after him, without adding another word, and returned to his apartments; and when Madame Danglars recovered from her half-fainting condition, she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream.Chapter 66.Matrimonial Projects  The day following this scene, at the hour Debray usually chose to pay a visit to Madame Danglars on his way to his office, his coupé did not appear.At this time, that is, about half-past twelve, Madame Danglars ordered her carriage, and went out.Danglars, hidden behind a curtain, watched the departure he had been waiting for.He gave orders that he should be informed as soon as Madame Danglars appeared; but at two o’clock she had not returned.He then called for his horses, drove to the Chamber, and inscribed his name to speak against the budget.From twelve to two o’clock Danglars had remained in his study, unsealing his dispatches, and becoming more and more sad every minute, heaping figure upon figure, and receiving, among other visits, one from Major Cavalcanti, who, as stiff and exact as ever, presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before, to terminate his business with the banker.On leaving the Chamber, Danglars, who had shown violent marks of agitation during the sitting, and been more bitter than ever against the ministry, re-entered his carriage, and told the coachman to drive to the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, No.30.Monte Cristo was at home; only he was engaged with someone and begged Danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing-room.",

Thomson & French, Via dei Banchi, Rome; give me a draft for 4,998 louis on these gentlemen, and our banker shall take it.”Danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace, so he took the pen, ink, and paper Peppino offered him, wrote the draft, and signed it.“Here,” he said, “here is a draft at sight.”“And here is your fowl.”Danglars sighed while he carved the fowl; it appeared very thin for the price it had cost.As for Peppino, he examined the paper attentively, put it into his pocket, and continued eating his peas.Chapter 116.",

    "snippet_post_context": "“Pardon for whom?”cried he.Peppino remained breathless.“A pardon for Peppino, called Rocca Priori,” said the principal friar.And he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers, who read and returned it to him.“For Peppino!”cried Andrea, who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been plunged. “Why for him and not for me?We ought to die together.I was promised he should die with me.You have no right to put me to death alone.I will not die alone—I will not!”And he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast, and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands.The executioner made a sign, and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized him.“What is going on?”asked Franz of the count; for, as all the talk was in the Roman dialect, he had not perfectly understood it.",
    "history": "It consisted, as we have said, of a small dressing-room, opening into a bedroom, and, when the door of communication was shut, the inmates were quite alone.On chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin.20167m   “As you left the choice of your costumes to me,” said the count to the two friends, “I have had these brought, as they will be the most worn this year; and they are most suitable, on account of the confetti (sweetmeats), as they do not show the flour.”Franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly, and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes; for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the Piazza del Popolo presented, and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre.It was the first time Franz had ever seen a guillotine,—we say guillotine, because the Roman mandaïa is formed on almost the same model as the French instrument.7 The knife, which is shaped like a crescent, that cuts with the convex side, falls from a less height, and that is all the difference.Two men, seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid, were eating their breakfasts, while waiting for the criminal.Their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages.One of them lifted the plank, took out a flask of wine, drank some, and then passed it to his companion.These two men were the executioner’s assistants.At this sight Franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow.The prisoners, transported the previous evening from the Carceri Nuove to the little church of Santa Maria del Popolo, had passed the night, each accompanied by two priests, in a chapel closed by a grating, before which were two sentinels, who were relieved at intervals.A double line of carbineers, placed on each side of the door of the church, reached to the scaffold, and formed a circle around it, leaving a path about ten feet wide, and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred feet.All the rest of the square was paved with heads.Many women held their infants on their shoulders, and thus the children had the best view.The Monte Pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators; the balconies of the two churches at the corner of the Via del Babuino and the Via di Ripetta were crammed; the steps even seemed a parti- sea, that was impelled towards the portico; every niche in the wall held its living statue.What the count said was true—the most curious spectacle in life is that of death.And yet, instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion, laughter and jests arose from the crowd.It was evident that the execution was, in the eyes of the people, only the commencement of the Carnival.Suddenly the tumult ceased, as if by magic, and the doors of the church opened.A brotherhood of penitents, clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth, with holes for the eyes, and holding in their hands lighted tapers, appeared first; the chief marched at the head.20169m   Behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions.He was naked, with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath, and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledge-hammer.This man was the executioner.He had, moreover, sandals bound on his feet by cords.Behind the executioner came, in the order in which they were to die, first Peppino and then Andrea.Each was accompanied by two priests.Neither had his eyes bandaged.Peppino walked with a firm step, doubtless aware of what awaited him.Andrea was supported by two priests.Each of them, from time to time, kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them.At this sight alone Franz felt his legs tremble under him.He looked at Albert—he was as white as his shirt, and mechanically cast away his cigar, although he had not half smoked it.The count alone seemed unmoved—nay, more, a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks.His nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey, and his lips, half opened, disclosed his white teeth, small and sharp like those of a jackal.And yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness, such as Franz had never before witnessed in them; his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity.However, the two culprits advanced, and as they approached their faces became visible.Peppino was a handsome young man of four or five-and- twenty, bronzed by the sun; he carried his head erect, and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would appear.Andrea was short and fat; his visage, marked with brutal cruelty, did not indicate age; he might be thirty.In prison he had suffered his beard to grow; his head fell on his shoulder, his legs bent beneath him, and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious.",

    "history": "“What, M. de Villefort,” cried the president, “do you yield to an hallucination?What, are you no longer in possession of your senses?This strange, unexpected, terrible accusation has disordered your reason.Come, recover.”The procureur dropped his head; his teeth chattered like those of a man under a violent attack of fever, and yet he was deadly pale.“I am in possession of all my senses, sir,” he said; “my body alone suffers, as you may suppose.I acknowledge myself guilty of all the young man has brought against me, and from this hour hold myself under the authority of the procureur who will succeed me.”And as he spoke these words with a hoarse, choking voice, he staggered towards the door, which was mechanically opened by a door-keeper.The whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which had been expected during the last fortnight by the Parisian world.“Well,” said Beauchamp, “let them now say that drama is unnatural!”“Ma foi!”said Château-Renaud, “I would rather end my career like M. de Morcerf; a pistol-shot seems quite delightful compared with this catastrophe.”“And moreover, it kills,” said Beauchamp.“And to think that I had an idea of marrying his daughter,” said Debray.“She did well to die, poor girl!”“The sitting is adjourned, gentlemen,” said the president; “fresh inquiries will be made, and the case will be tried next session by another magistrate.”As for Andrea, who was calm and more interesting than ever, he left the hall, escorted by gendarmes, who involuntarily paid him some attention.“Well, what do you think of this, my fine fellow?”asked Debray of the sergeant-at-arms, slipping a louis into his hand.“There will be extenuating circumstances,” he replied.Chapter 111.Expiation  Notwithstanding the density of the crowd, M. de Villefort saw it open before him.There is something so awe-inspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe.Many people have been assassinated in a tumult, but even criminals have rarely been insulted during trial.Thus Villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the Palais, and withdrew.Though he had acknowledged his guilt, he was protected by his grief.There are some situations which men understand by instinct, but which reason is powerless to explain; in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives utterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of sorrow.Those who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an entire poem, and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in regarding his outburst as sublime.It would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which Villefort left the Palais.Every pulse beat with feverish excitement, every nerve was strained, every vein swollen, and every part of his body seemed to suffer distinctly from the rest, thus multiplying his agony a thousand- fold.He made his way along the corridors through force of habit; he threw aside his magisterial robe, not out of deference to etiquette, but because it was an unbearable burden, a veritable garb of Nessus, insatiate in torture.Having staggered as far as the Rue Dauphine, he perceived his carriage, awoke his sleeping coachman by opening the door himself, threw himself on the cushions, and pointed towards the Faubourg Saint-Honoré; the carriage drove on.All the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him; he could not foresee the consequences; he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency already familiar.God was still in his heart. “God,” he murmured, not knowing what he said,—“God—God!”Behind the event that had overwhelmed him he saw the hand of God.The carriage rolled rapidly onward.Villefort, while turning restlessly on the cushions, felt something press against him.He put out his hand to remove the object; it was a fan which Madame de Villefort had left in the carriage; this fan awakened a recollection which darted through his mind like lightning.He thought of his wife.50189m   “Oh!”he exclaimed, as though a red-hot iron were piercing his heart.During the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind; now another object, not less terrible, suddenly presented itself.His wife!He had just acted the inexorable judge with her, he had condemned her to death, and she, crushed by remorse, struck with terror, covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of his irreproachable virtue,—she, a poor, weak woman, without help or the power of defending herself against his absolute and supreme will,—she might at that very moment, perhaps, be preparing to die!",

    "history": "A fall of more than two hundred feet and the pavement.In this terrible situation, the archdeacon said not a word, uttered not a groan.He merely writhed upon the spout, with incredible efforts to climb up again; but his hands had no hold on the granite, his feet slid along the blackened wall without catching fast.People who have ascended the towers of Notre-Dame know that there is a swell of the stone immediately beneath the balustrade.It was on this retreating angle that miserable archdeacon exhausted himself.He had not to deal with a perpendicular wall, but with one which sloped away beneath him.Quasimodo had but to stretch out his hand in order to draw him from the gulf; but he did not even look at him.He was looking at the Greve.He was looking at the gallows.He was looking at the gypsy.The deaf man was leaning, with his elbows on the balustrade, at the spot where the archdeacon had been a moment before, and there, never detaching his gaze from the only object which existed for him in the world at that moment, he remained motionless and mute, like a man struck by lightning, and a long stream of tears flowed in silence from that eye which, up to that time, had never shed but one tear.Meanwhile, the archdeacon was panting.His bald brow was dripping with perspiration, his nails were bleeding against the stones, his knees were flayed by the wall.He heard his cassock, which was caught on the spout, crack and rip at every jerk that he gave it.To complete his misfortune, this spout ended in a leaden pipe which bent under the weight of his body.The archdeacon felt this pipe slowly giving way.The miserable man said to himself that, when his hands should be worn out with fatigue, when his cassock should tear asunder, when the lead should give way, he would be obliged to fall, and terror seized upon his very vitals.Now and then he glanced wildly at a sort of narrow shelf formed, ten feet lower down, by projections of the sculpture, and he prayed heaven, from the depths of his distressed soul, that he might be allowed to finish his life, were it to last two centuries, on that space two feet square.Once, he glanced below him into the Place, into the abyss; the head which he raised again had its eyes closed and its hair standing erect.There was something frightful in the silence of these two men.While the archdeacon agonized in this terrible fashion a few feet below him, Quasimodo wept and gazed at the Greve.The archdeacon, seeing that all his exertions served only to weaken the fragile support which remained to him, decided to remain quiet.There he hung, embracing the gutter, hardly breathing, no longer stirring, making no longer any other movements than that mechanical convulsion of the stomach, which one experiences in dreams when one fancies himself falling.His fixed eyes were wide open with a stare.He lost ground little by little, nevertheless, his fingers slipped along the spout; he became more and more conscious of the feebleness of his arms and the weight of his body.The curve of the lead which sustained him inclined more and more each instant towards the abyss.He beheld below him, a frightful thing, the roof of Saint-Jean le Rond, as small as a card folded in two.He gazed at the impressive carvings, one by one, of the tower, suspended like himself over the precipice, but without terror for themselves or pity for him.All was stone around him; before his eyes, gaping monsters; below, quite at the bottom, in the Place, the pavement; above his head, Quasimodo weeping.In the Parvis there were several groups of curious good people, who were tranquilly seeking to divine who the madman could be who was amusing himself in so strange a manner.The priest heard them saying, for their voices reached him, clear and shrill: \"Why, he will break his neck!\"Quasimodo wept.At last the archdeacon, foaming with rage and despair, understood that all was in vain.Nevertheless, he collected all the strength which remained to him for a final effort.He stiffened himself upon the spout, pushed against the wall with both his knees, clung to a crevice in the stones with his hands, and succeeded in climbing back with one foot, perhaps; but this effort made the leaden beak on which he rested bend abruptly.His cassock burst open at the same time.Then, feeling everything give way beneath him, with nothing but his stiffened and failing hands to support him, the unfortunate man closed his eyes and let go of the spout.He fell.Quasimodo watched him fall.A fall from such a height is seldom perpendicular.The archdeacon, launched into space, fell at first head foremost, with outspread hands; then he whirled over and over many times; the wind blew him upon the roof of a house, where the unfortunate man began to break up.Nevertheless, he was not dead when he reached there.The bellringer saw him still endeavor to cling to a gable with his nails; but the surface sloped too much, and he had no more strength",

    "history": "One thing is certain, that la Esmeralda had come to France while still very young, by way of Hungary.From all these countries the young girl had brought back fragments of queer jargons, songs, and strange ideas, which made her language as motley as her costume, half Parisian, half African.However, the people of the quarters which she frequented loved her for her gayety, her daintiness, her lively manners, her dances, and her songs.She believed herself to be hated, in all the city, by but two persons, of whom she often spoke in terror: the sacked nun of the Tour-Roland, a villanous recluse who cherished some secret grudge against these gypsies, and who cursed the poor dancer every time that the latter passed before her window; and a priest, who never met her without casting at her looks and words which frightened her.The mention of this last circumstance disturbed the archdeacon greatly, though Gringoire paid no attention to his perturbation; to such an extent had two months sufficed to cause the heedless poet to forget the singular details of the evening on which he had met the gypsy, and the presence of the archdeacon in it all.Otherwise, the little dancer feared nothing; she did not tell fortunes, which protected her against those trials for magic which were so frequently instituted against gypsy women.And then, Gringoire held the position of her brother, if not of her husband.After all, the philosopher endured this sort of platonic marriage very patiently.It meant a shelter and bread at least.Every morning, he set out from the lair of the thieves, generally with the gypsy; he helped her make her collections of targes* and little blanks** in the squares; each evening he returned to the same roof with her, allowed her to bolt herself into her little chamber, and slept the sleep of the just.A very sweet existence, taking it all in all, he said, and well adapted to revery.And then, on his soul and conscience, the philosopher was not very sure that he was madly in love with the gypsy.He loved her goat almost as dearly.It was a charming animal, gentle, intelligent, clever; a learned goat.Nothing was more common in the Middle Ages than these learned animals, which amazed people greatly, and often led their instructors to the stake.But the witchcraft of the goat with the golden hoofs was a very innocent species of magic.Gringoire explained them to the archdeacon, whom these details seemed to interest deeply.In the majority of cases, it was sufficient to present the tambourine to the goat in such or such a manner, in order to obtain from him the trick desired.He had been trained to this by the gypsy, who possessed, in these delicate arts, so rare a talent that two months had sufficed to teach the goat to write, with movable letters, the word \"Phoebus.\"*  An ancient Burgundian coin.** An ancient French coin.\"'Phoebus!'\"said the priest; \"why 'Phoebus'?\"\"I know not,\" replied Gringoire. \"Perhaps it is a word which she believes to be endowed with some magic and secret virtue.She often repeats it in a low tone when she thinks that she is alone.\"\"Are you sure,\" persisted Claude, with his penetrating glance, \"that it is only a word and not a name?\"\"The name of whom?\"said the poet.\"How should I know?\"said the priest.\"This is what I imagine, messire.These Bohemians are something like Guebrs, and adore the sun.Hence, Phoebus.\"\"That does not seem so clear to me as to you, Master Pierre.\"\"After all, that does not concern me.Let her mumble her Phoebus at her pleasure.One thing is certain, that Djali loves me almost as much as he does her.\"\"Who is Djali?\"\"The goat.\"The archdeacon dropped his chin into his hand, and appeared to reflect for a moment.All at once he turned abruptly to Gringoire once more.\"And do you swear to me that you have not touched her?\"\"Whom?\"said Gringoire; \"the goat?\"\"No, that woman.\"\"My wife?I swear to you that I have not.\"\"You are often alone with her?\"\"A good hour every evening.\"Porn Claude frowned.\"Oh!oh! _Solus cum sola non cogitabuntur orare Pater Noster_.\"\"Upon my soul, I could say the _Pater_, and the _Ave Maria_, and the _Credo in Deum patrem omnipotentem_ without her paying any more attention to me than a chicken to a church.\"\"Swear to me, by the body of your mother,\" repeated the archdeacon violently, \"that you have not touched that creature with even the tip of your finger.\"\"I will also swear it by the head of my father, for the two things have more affinity between them.But, my reverend master, permit me a question in my turn.\"\"Speak, sir.\"\"What concern is it of yours?\"",

FROM CHARYBDIS TO SCYLLA.Night comes on early in January.The streets were already dark when Gringoire issued forth from the Courts.This gloom pleased him; he was in haste to reach some obscure and deserted alley, in order there to meditate at his ease, and in order that the philosopher might place the first dressing upon the wound of the poet.Philosophy, moreover, was his sole refuge, for he did not know where he was to lodge for the night.After the brilliant failure of his first theatrical venture, he dared not return to the lodging which he occupied in the Rue Grenier-sur-l'Eau, opposite to the Port-au-Foin, having depended upon receiving from monsieur the provost for his epithalamium, the wherewithal to pay Master Guillaume Doulx-Sire, farmer of the taxes on cloven-footed animals in Paris, the rent which he owed him, that is to say, twelve sols parisian; twelve times the value of all that he possessed in the world, including his trunk-hose, his shirt, and his cap.After reflecting a moment, temporarily sheltered beneath the little wicket of the prison of the treasurer of the Sainte-Chappelle, as to the shelter which he would select for the night, having all the pavements of Paris to choose from, he remembered to have noticed the week previously in the Rue de la Savaterie, at the door of a councillor of the parliament, a stepping stone for mounting a mule, and to have said to himself that that stone would furnish, on occasion, a very excellent pillow for a mendicant or a poet.He thanked Providence for having sent this happy idea to him; but, as he was preparing to cross the Place, in order to reach the tortuous labyrinth of the city, where meander all those old sister streets, the Rues de la Barillerie, de la Vielle-Draperie, de la Savaterie, de la Juiverie, etc.,still extant to-day, with their nine-story houses, he saw the procession of the Pope of the Fools, which was also emerging from the court house, and rushing across the courtyard, with great cries, a great flashing of torches, and the music which belonged to him, Gringoire.This sight revived the pain of his self-love; he fled.In the bitterness of his dramatic misadventure, everything which reminded him of the festival of that day irritated his wound and made it bleed.58  He was on the point of turning to the Pont Saint-Michel; children were running about here and there with fire lances and rockets.\"Pest on firework candles!\"said Gringoire; and he fell back on the Pont au Change.To the house at the head of the bridge there had been affixed three small banners, representing the king, the dauphin, and Marguerite of Flanders, and six little pennons on which were portrayed the Duke of Austria, the Cardinal de Bourbon, M. de Beaujeu, and Madame Jeanne de France, and Monsieur the Bastard of Bourbon, and I know not whom else; all being illuminated with torches.The rabble were admiring.\"Happy painter, Jehan Fourbault!\"said Gringoire with a deep sigh; and he turned his back upon the bannerets and pennons.A street opened before him; he thought it so dark and deserted that he hoped to there escape from all the rumors as well as from all the gleams of the festival.At the end of a few moments his foot came in contact with an obstacle; he stumbled and fell.It was the May truss, which the clerks of the clerks' law court had deposited that morning at the door of a president of the parliament, in honor of the solemnity of the day.Gringoire bore this new disaster heroically; he picked himself up, and reached the water's edge.After leaving behind him the civic Tournelle* and the criminal tower, and skirted the great walls of the king's garden, on that unpaved strand where the mud reached to his ankles, he reached the western point of the city, and considered for some time the islet of the Passeur-aux-Vaches, which has disappeared beneath the bronze horse of the Pont Neuf.The islet appeared to him in the shadow like a black mass, beyond the narrow strip of whitish water which separated him from it.One could divine by the ray of a tiny light the sort of hut in the form of a beehive where the ferryman of cows took refuge at night.*  A chamber of the ancient parliament of Paris.\"Happy ferryman!\"thought Gringoire; \"",

'tis an evil thing, and the confusion of it displeases me.I should greatly like to know whether it be the mercy of God that there should be in Paris any other lord than the king, any other judge than our parliament, any other emperor than ourselves in this empire!By the faith of my soul!the day must certainly come when there shall exist in France but one king, one lord, one judge, one headsman, as there is in paradise but one God!\"He lifted his cap again, and continued, still dreamily, with the air and accent of a hunter who is cheering on his pack of hounds: \"Good, my people!bravely done!break these false lords!do your duty!at them!have at them!pillage them!take them!sack them!...Ah!you want to be kings, messeigneurs?On, my people on!\"Here he interrupted himself abruptly, bit his lips as though to take back his thought which had already half escaped, bent his piercing eyes in turn on each of the five persons who surrounded him, and suddenly grasping his hat with both hands and staring full at it, he said to it: \"Oh!I would burn you if you knew what there was in my head.\"Then casting about him once more the cautious and uneasy glance of the fox re-entering his hole,--  \"No matter!we will succor monsieur the bailiff.Unfortunately, we have but few troops here at the present moment, against so great a populace.We must wait until to-morrow.The order will be transmitted to the City and every one who is caught will be immediately hung.\"\"By the way, sire,\" said Gossip Coictier, \"I had forgotten that in the first agitation, the watch have seized two laggards of the band.If your majesty desires to see these men, they are here.\"\"If I desire to see them!\"cried the king. \"What! _Pasque-Dieu_!You forget a thing like that!Run quick, you, Olivier!Go, seek them!\"Master Olivier quitted the room and returned a moment later with the two prisoners, surrounded by archers of the guard.The first had a coarse, idiotic, drunken and astonished face.He was clothed in rags, and walked with one knee bent and dragging his leg.The second had a pallid and smiling countenance, with which the reader is already acquainted.The king surveyed them for a moment without uttering a word, then addressing the first one abruptly,--  \"What's your name?\"\"Gieffroy Pincebourde.\"\"Your trade.\"\"Outcast.\"\"What were you going to do in this damnable sedition?\"The outcast stared at the king, and swung his arms with a stupid air.He had one of those awkwardly shaped heads where intelligence is about as much at its ease as a light beneath an extinguisher.\"I know not,\" said he. \"They went, I went.\"\"Were you not going to outrageously attack and pillage your lord, the bailiff of the palace?\"\"I know that they were going to take something from some one.That is all.\"A soldier pointed out to the king a billhook which he had seized on the person of the vagabond.\"Do you recognize this weapon?\"demanded the king.\"Yes; 'tis my billhook; I am a vine-dresser.\"\"And do you recognize this man as your companion?\"added Louis XI.,pointing to the other prisoner.\"No, I do not know him.\"\"That will do,\" said the king, making a sign with his finger to the silent personage who stood motionless beside the door, to whom we have already called the reader's attention.\"Gossip Tristan, here is a man for you.\"Tristan l'Hermite bowed.He gave an order in a low voice to two archers, who led away the poor vagabond.In the meantime, the king had approached the second prisoner, who was perspiring in great drops: \"Your name?\"\"Sire, Pierre Gringoire.\"\"Your trade?\"\"Philosopher, sire.\"\"How do you permit yourself, knave, to go and besiege our friend, monsieur the bailiff of the palace, and what",

    "snippet_post_context": "One of the men who held the young girl turned towards him.It was the formidable visage of Quasimodo.Gringoire did not take to flight, but neither did he advance another step.Quasimodo came up to him, tossed him four paces away on the pavement with a backward turn of the hand, and plunged rapidly into the gloom, bearing the young girl folded across one arm like a silken scarf.His companion followed him, and the poor goat ran after them all, bleating plaintively.\"Murder!murder!\"shrieked the unhappy gypsy.\"Halt, rascals, and yield me that wench!\"suddenly shouted in a voice of thunder, a cavalier who appeared suddenly from a neighboring square.It was a captain of the king's archers, armed from head to foot, with his sword in his hand.",
    "history": "Gringoire set out to follow the gypsy at all hazards.He had seen her, accompanied by her goat, take to the Rue de la Coutellerie; he took the Rue de la Coutellerie.\"Why not?\"he said to himself.Gringoire, a practical philosopher of the streets of Paris, had noticed that nothing is more propitious to revery than following a pretty woman without knowing whither she is going.There was in this voluntary abdication of his freewill, in this fancy submitting itself to another fancy, which suspects it not, a mixture of fantastic independence and blind obedience, something indescribable, intermediate between slavery and liberty, which pleased Gringoire,--a spirit essentially compound, undecided, and complex, holding the extremities of all extremes, incessantly suspended between all human propensities, and neutralizing one by the other.He was fond of comparing himself to Mahomet's coffin, attracted in two different directions by two loadstones, and hesitating eternally between the heights and the depths, between the vault and the pavement, between fall and ascent, between zenith and nadir.If Gringoire had lived in our day, what a fine middle course he would hold between classicism and romanticism!But he was not sufficiently primitive to live three hundred years, and 'tis a pity.His absence is a void which is but too sensibly felt to-day.Moreover, for the purpose of thus following passers-by (and especially female passers-by) in the streets, which Gringoire was fond of doing, there is no better disposition than ignorance of where one is going to sleep.So he walked along, very thoughtfully, behind the young girl, who hastened her pace and made her goat trot as she saw the bourgeois returning home and the taverns--the only shops which had been open that day--closing.\"After all,\" he half thought to himself, \"she must lodge somewhere; gypsies have kindly hearts.Who knows?--\"  And in the points of suspense which he placed after this reticence in his mind, there lay I know not what flattering ideas.Meanwhile, from time to time, as he passed the last groups of bourgeois closing their doors, he caught some scraps of their conversation, which broke the thread of his pleasant hypotheses.Now it was two old men accosting each other.\"Do you know that it is cold, Master Thibaut Fernicle?\" (Gringoire had been aware of this since the beginning of the winter.)\"Yes, indeed, Master Boniface Disome!Are we going to have a winter such as we had three years ago, in '80, when wood cost eight sous the measure?\"\"Bah!that's nothing, Master Thibaut, compared with the winter of 1407, when it froze from St. Martin's Day until Candlemas!and so cold that the pen of the registrar of the parliament froze every three words, in the Grand Chamber!which interrupted the registration of justice.\"Further on there were two female neighbors at their windows, holding candles, which the fog caused to sputter.\"Has your husband told you about the mishap, Mademoiselle la Boudraque?\"\"No.What is it, Mademoiselle Turquant?\"\"The horse of M. Gilles Godin, the notary at the Chatelet, took fright at the Flemings and their procession, and overturned Master Philippe Avrillot, lay monk of the Celestins.\"\"Really?\"\"Actually.\"\"A bourgeois horse! 'tis rather too much!If it had been a cavalry horse, well and good!\"And the windows were closed.But Gringoire had lost the thread of his ideas, nevertheless.Fortunately, he speedily found it again, and he knotted it together without difficulty, thanks to the gypsy, thanks to Djali, who still walked in front of him; two fine, delicate, and charming creatures, whose tiny feet, beautiful forms, and graceful manners he was engaged in admiring, almost confusing them in his contemplation; believing them to be both young girls, from their intelligence and good friendship; regarding them both as goats,--so far as the lightness, agility, and dexterity of their walk were concerned.But the streets were becoming blacker and more deserted every moment.The curfew had sounded long ago, and it was only at rare intervals now that they encountered a passer-by in the street, or a light in the windows.Gringoire had become involved, in his pursuit of the gypsy, in that inextricable labyrinth of alleys, squares, and closed courts which surround the ancient sepulchre of the Saints-Innocents, and which resembles a ball of thread tangled by a cat. \"Here are streets which possess but little logic!\"said Gringoire, lost in the thousands of circuits which returned upon themselves incessantly, but where the young girl pursued a road which seemed familiar to her, without hesitation and with a step which became ever more rapid.As for him, he would have been utterly ignorant of his situation had he not espied, in passing, at the turn of a street, the octagonal mass of the pillory of the fish markets, the open-work summit of which threw its black, fretted outlines clearly upon a window which was still lighted in the Rue Ver",

    "snippet_former_context": "Each section of this grotesque procession had its own music.The Egyptians made their drums and African tambourines resound.The slang men, not a very musical race, still clung to the goat's horn trumpet and the Gothic rubebbe of the twelfth century.The Empire of Galilee was not much more advanced; among its music one could hardly distinguish some miserable rebec, from the infancy of the art, still imprisoned in the _re-la-mi_.But it was around the Pope of the Fools that all the musical riches of the epoch were displayed in a magnificent discord.It was nothing but soprano rebecs, counter-tenor rebecs, and tenor rebecs, not to reckon the flutes and brass instruments.Alas!our readers will remember that this was Gringoire's orchestra.",

    "history": "It was indefinable and charming; something pure and sonorous, aerial, winged, so to speak.There were continual outbursts, melodies, unexpected cadences, then simple phrases strewn with aerial and hissing notes; then floods of scales which would have put a nightingale to rout, but in which harmony was always present; then soft modulations of octaves which rose and fell, like the bosom of the young singer.Her beautiful face followed, with singular mobility, all the caprices of her song, from the wildest inspiration to the chastest dignity.One would have pronounced her now a mad creature, now a queen.The words which she sang were in a tongue unknown to Gringoire, and which seemed to him to be unknown to herself, so little relation did the expression which she imparted to her song bear to the sense of the words.Thus, these four lines, in her mouth, were madly gay,--     _Un cofre de gran riqueza     Hallaron dentro un pilar,   Dentro del, nuevas banderas    Con figuras de espantar_.**  A coffer of great richness     In a pillar's heart they found,    Within it lay new banners,     With figures to astound.And an instant afterwards, at the accents which she imparted to this stanza,--     _Alarabes de cavallo    Sin poderse menear,   Con espadas, y los cuellos,    Ballestas de buen echar_,   Gringoire felt the tears start to his eyes.Nevertheless, her song breathed joy, most of all, and she seemed to sing like a bird, from serenity and heedlessness.The gypsy's song had disturbed Gringoire's revery as the swan disturbs the water.He listened in a sort of rapture, and forgetfulness of everything.It was the first moment in the course of many hours when he did not feel that he suffered.The moment was brief.The same woman's voice, which had interrupted the gypsy's dance, interrupted her song.\"Will you hold your tongue, you cricket of hell?\"it cried, still from the same obscure corner of the place.The poor \"cricket\" stopped short.Gringoire covered up his ears.\"Oh!\"he exclaimed, \"accursed saw with missing teeth, which comes to break the lyre!\"Meanwhile, the other spectators murmured like himself; \"To the devil with the sacked nun!\"said some of them.And the old invisible kill-joy might have had occasion to repent of her aggressions against the gypsy had their attention not been diverted at this moment by the procession of the Pope of the Fools, which, after having traversed many streets and squares, debouched on the Place de Greve, with all its torches and all its uproar.This procession, which our readers have seen set out from the Palais de Justice, had organized on the way, and had been recruited by all the knaves, idle thieves, and unemployed vagabonds in Paris; so that it presented a very respectable aspect when it arrived at the Greve.First came Egypt.The Duke of Egypt headed it, on horseback, with his counts on foot holding his bridle and stirrups for him; behind them, the male and female Egyptians, pell-mell, with their little children crying on their shoulders; all--duke, counts, and populace--in rags and tatters.Then came the Kingdom of Argot; that is to say, all the thieves of France, arranged according to the order of their dignity; the minor people walking first.Thus defiled by fours, with the divers insignia of their grades, in that strange faculty, most of them lame, some <DW36>s, others one-armed, shop clerks, pilgrim, _hubins_, bootblacks, thimble-riggers, street arabs, beggars, the blear-eyed beggars, thieves, the weakly, vagabonds, merchants, sham soldiers, goldsmiths, passed masters of pickpockets, isolated thieves.A catalogue that would weary Homer.In the centre of the conclave of the passed masters of pickpockets, one had some difficulty in distinguishing the King of Argot, the grand coesre, so called, crouching in a little cart drawn by two big dogs.After the kingdom of the Argotiers, came the Empire of Galilee.Guillaume Rousseau, Emperor of the Empire of Galilee, marched majestically in his robe of purple, spotted with wine, preceded by buffoons wrestling and executing military dances; surrounded by his macebearers, his pickpockets and clerks of the chamber of accounts.Last of all came the corporation of law clerks, with its maypoles crowned with flowers, its black robes, its music worthy of the orgy, and its large candles of yellow wax.In the centre of this crowd, the grand officers of the Brotherhood of Fools bore on their shoulders a litter more loaded down with candles than the reliquary of Sainte-Genevieve in time of pest; and on this litter shone res",

    "history": "These myriad bells, with their little copper tongues, seemed to him like the mouths of so many asps, open and ready to sting and to hiss.\"Oh!\"he said, in a very low voice, \"is it possible that my life depends on the slightest vibration of the least of these bells?Oh!\"he added, with clasped hands, \"bells, do not ring, hand-bells do not clang, mule-bells do not quiver!\"He made one more attempt upon Trouillefou.\"And if there should come a gust of wind?\"\"You will be hanged,\" replied the other, without hesitation.Perceiving that no respite, nor reprieve, nor subterfuge was possible, he bravely decided upon his course of action; he wound his right foot round his left leg, raised himself on his left foot, and stretched out his arm: but at the moment when his hand touched the manikin, his body, which was now supported upon one leg only, wavered on the stool which had but three; he made an involuntary effort to support himself by the manikin, lost his balance, and fell heavily to the ground, deafened by the fatal vibration of the thousand bells of the manikin, which, yielding to the impulse imparted by his hand, described first a rotary motion, and then swayed majestically between the two posts.\"Malediction!\"he cried as he fell, and remained as though dead, with his face to the earth.Meanwhile, he heard the dreadful peal above his head, the diabolical laughter of the vagabonds, and the voice of Trouillefou saying,--  \"Pick me up that knave, and hang him without ceremony.\"He rose.They had already detached the manikin to make room for him.The thieves made him mount the stool, Clopin came to him, passed the rope about his neck, and, tapping him on the shoulder,--  \"Adieu, my friend.You can't escape now, even if you digested with the pope's guts.\"The word \"Mercy!\"died away upon Gringoire's lips.He cast his eyes about him; but there was no hope: all were laughing.\"Bellevigne de l'Etoile,\" said the King of Thunes to an enormous vagabond, who stepped out from the ranks, \"climb upon the cross beam.\"Bellevigne de l'Etoile nimbly mounted the transverse beam, and in another minute, Gringoire, on raising his eyes, beheld him, with terror, seated upon the beam above his head.\"Now,\" resumed Clopin Trouillefou, \"as soon as I clap my hands, you, Andry the Red, will fling the stool to the ground with a blow of your knee; you, Francois Chante-Prune, will cling to the feet of the rascal; and you, Bellevigne, will fling yourself on his shoulders; and all three at once, do you hear?\"Gringoire shuddered.\"Are you ready?\"said Clopin Trouillefou to the three thieves, who held themselves in readiness to fall upon Gringoire.A moment of horrible suspense ensued for the poor victim, during which Clopin tranquilly thrust into the fire with the tip of his foot, some bits of vine shoots which the flame had not caught. \"Are you ready?\"he repeated, and opened his hands to clap.One second more and all would have been over.But he paused, as though struck by a sudden thought.\"One moment!\"said he; \"I forgot!It is our custom not to hang a man without inquiring whether there is any woman who wants him.Comrade, this is your last resource.You must wed either a female vagabond or the noose.\"This law of the vagabonds, singular as it may strike the reader, remains to-day written out at length, in ancient English legislation. (See _Burington's Observations_.)Gringoire breathed again.This was the second time that he had returned to life within an hour.So he did not dare to trust to it too implicitly.\"Hola!\"cried Clopin, mounted once more upon his cask, \"hola!women, females, is there among you, from the sorceress to her cat, a wench who wants this rascal?Hola, Colette la Charonne!Elisabeth Trouvain!Simone Jodouyne!Marie Piedebou!Thonne la Longue!Berarde Fanouel!Michelle Genaille!Claude Ronge-oreille!Mathurine Girorou!--Hola!Isabeau-la-Thierrye!Come and see!A man for nothing!Who wants him?\"Gringoire, no doubt, was not very appetizing in this miserable condition.The female vagabonds did not seem to be much affected by the proposition.The unhappy wretch heard them answer: \"No!no!hang him; there'll be the more fun for us all!\"Nevertheless, three emerged from the throng and came to smell of him.The first was a big wench, with a square face.",

    "history": "\"Vah!\"he cried, with a senseless burst of laughter.However, the movement of the bass was accelerated, and, in proportion as it described a wider angle, Quasimodo's eye opened also more and more widely, phosphoric and flaming.At length the grand peal began; the whole tower trembled; woodwork, leads, cut stones, all groaned at once, from the piles of the foundation to the trefoils of its summit.Then Quasimodo boiled and frothed; he went and came; he trembled from head to foot with the tower.The bell, furious, running riot, presented to the two walls of the tower alternately its brazen throat, whence escaped that tempestuous breath, which is audible leagues away.Quasimodo stationed himself in front of this open throat; he crouched and rose with the oscillations of the bell, breathed in this overwhelming breath, gazed by turns at the deep place, which swarmed with people, two hundred feet below him, and at that enormous, brazen tongue which came, second after second, to howl in his ear.It was the only speech which he understood, the only sound which broke for him the universal silence.He swelled out in it as a bird does in the sun.All of a sudden, the frenzy of the bell seized upon him; his look became extraordinary; he lay in wait for the great bell as it passed, as a spider lies in wait for a fly, and flung himself abruptly upon it, with might and main.Then, suspended above the abyss, borne to and fro by the formidable swinging of the bell, he seized the brazen monster by the ear-laps, pressed it between both knees, spurred it on with his heels, and redoubled the fury of the peal with the whole shock and weight of his body.Meanwhile, the tower trembled; he shrieked and gnashed his teeth, his red hair rose erect, his breast heaving like a bellows, his eye flashed flames, the monstrous bell neighed, panting, beneath him; and then it was no longer the great bell of Notre-Dame nor Quasimodo: it was a dream, a whirlwind, a tempest, dizziness mounted astride of noise; a spirit clinging to a flying crupper, a strange centaur, half man, half bell; a sort of horrible Astolphus, borne away upon a prodigious hippogriff of living bronze.The presence of this extraordinary being caused, as it were, a breath of life to circulate throughout the entire cathedral.It seemed as though there escaped from him, at least according to the growing superstitions of the crowd, a mysterious emanation which animated all the stones of Notre-Dame, and made the deep bowels of the ancient church to palpitate.It sufficed for people to know that he was there, to make them believe that they beheld the thousand statues of the galleries and the fronts in motion.And the cathedral did indeed seem a docile and obedient creature beneath his hand; it waited on his will to raise its great voice; it was possessed and filled with Quasimodo, as with a familiar spirit.One would have said that he made the immense edifice breathe.He was everywhere about it; in fact, he multiplied himself on all points of the structure.Now one perceived with affright at the very top of one of the towers, a fantastic dwarf climbing, writhing, crawling on all fours, descending outside above the abyss, leaping from projection to projection, and going to ransack the belly of some sculptured gorgon; it was Quasimodo dislodging the crows.Again, in some obscure corner of the church one came in contact with a sort of living chimera, crouching and scowling; it was Quasimodo engaged in thought.Sometimes one caught sight, upon a bell tower, of an enormous head and a bundle of disordered limbs swinging furiously at the end of a rope; it was Quasimodo ringing vespers or the Angelus.Often at night a hideous form was seen wandering along the frail balustrade of carved lacework, which crowns the towers and borders the circumference of the apse; again it was the hunchback of Notre-Dame.Then, said the women of the neighborhood, the whole church took on something fantastic, supernatural, horrible; eyes and mouths were opened, here and there; one heard the dogs, the monsters, and the gargoyles of stone, which keep watch night and day, with outstretched neck and open jaws, around the monstrous cathedral, barking.And, if it was a Christmas Eve, while the great bell, which seemed to emit the death rattle, summoned the faithful to the midnight mass, such an air was spread over the sombre facade that one would have declared that the grand portal was devouring the throng, and that the rose window was watching it.And all this came from Quasimodo.Egypt would have taken him for the god of this temple; the Middle Ages believed him to be its demon: he was in fact its soul.To such an extent was this disease that for those who know that Quasimodo has existed, Notre-Dame is to-day deserted, inanimate, dead.One feels that something has disappeared from it.That immense body",

'Tis as thickly clustered as the head of a cabbage!The apse is of a very devout, and so peculiar a fashion that I have never beheld anything like it elsewhere!\"Dom Claude interrupted him,--  \"You are happy, then?\"Gringoire replied warmly;--  \"On my honor, yes!First I loved women, then animals.Now I love stones.They are quite as amusing as women and animals, and less treacherous.\"The priest laid his hand on his brow.It was his habitual gesture.\"Really?\"\"Stay!\"said Gringoire, \"one has one's pleasures!\"He took the arm of the priest, who let him have his way, and made him enter the staircase turret of For-l'Eveque. \"Here is a staircase!every time that I see it I am happy.It is of the simplest and rarest manner of steps in Paris.All the steps are bevelled underneath.Its beauty and simplicity consist in the interspacing of both, being a foot or more wide, which are interlaced, interlocked, fitted together, enchained enchased, interlined one upon another, and bite into each other in a manner that is truly firm and graceful.\"\"And you desire nothing?\"\"No.\"\"And you regret nothing?\"\"Neither regret nor desire.I have arranged my mode of life.\"\"What men arrange,\" said Claude, \"things disarrange.\"\"I am a Pyrrhonian philosopher,\" replied Gringoire, \"and I hold all things in equilibrium.\"\"And how do you earn your living?\"\"I still make epics and tragedies now and then; but that which brings me in most is the industry with which you are acquainted, master; carrying pyramids of chairs in my teeth.\"\"The trade is but a rough one for a philosopher.\"\"'Tis still equilibrium,\" said Gringoire. \"When one has an idea, one encounters it in everything.\"\"I know that,\" replied the archdeacon.After a silence, the priest resumed,--  \"You are, nevertheless, tolerably poor?\"\"Poor, yes; unhappy, no.\"At that moment, a trampling of horses was heard, and our two interlocutors beheld defiling at the end of the street, a company of the king's unattached archers, their lances borne high, an officer at their head.The cavalcade was brilliant, and its march resounded on the pavement.\"How you gaze at that officer!\"said Gringoire, to the archdeacon.\"Because I think I recognize him.\"\"What do you call him?\"\"I think,\" said Claude, \"that his name is Phoebus de Chateaupers.\"\"Phoebus!A curious name!There is also a Phoebus, Comte de Foix.I remember having known a wench who swore only by the name of Ph",

'Tis against myself!\"Then, rendered young by fury, he began to walk up and down with long strides.He no longer laughed, he was terrible, he went and came; the fox was changed into a hyaena.He seemed suffocated to such a degree that he could not speak; his lips moved, and his fleshless fists were clenched.All at once he raised his head, his hollow eye appeared full of light, and his voice burst forth like a clarion: \"Down with them, Tristan!A heavy hand for these rascals!Go, Tristan, my friend!slay!slay!\"This eruption having passed, he returned to his seat, and said with cold and concentrated wrath,--  \"Here, Tristan!There are here with us in the Bastille the fifty lances of the Vicomte de Gif, which makes three hundred horse: you will take them.There is also the company of our unattached archers of Monsieur de Chateaupers: you will take it.You are provost of the marshals; you have the men of your provostship: you will take them.At the Hotel Saint-",

    "snippet_former_context": "This little pout had furnished Gringoire with food for thought.There was certainly both disdain and mockery in that graceful grimace.So he dropped his head, began to count the paving-stones, and to follow the young girl at a little greater distance, when, at the turn of a street, which had caused him to lose sight of her, he heard her utter a piercing cry.He hastened his steps.The street was full of shadows.Nevertheless, a twist of tow soaked in oil, which burned in a cage at the feet of the Holy Virgin at the street corner, permitted Gringoire to make out the gypsy struggling in the arms of two men, who were endeavoring to stifle her cries.The poor little goat, in great alarm, lowered his horns and bleated.",

    "history": "There was in this voluntary abdication of his freewill, in this fancy submitting itself to another fancy, which suspects it not, a mixture of fantastic independence and blind obedience, something indescribable, intermediate between slavery and liberty, which pleased Gringoire,--a spirit essentially compound, undecided, and complex, holding the extremities of all extremes, incessantly suspended between all human propensities, and neutralizing one by the other.He was fond of comparing himself to Mahomet's coffin, attracted in two different directions by two loadstones, and hesitating eternally between the heights and the depths, between the vault and the pavement, between fall and ascent, between zenith and nadir.If Gringoire had lived in our day, what a fine middle course he would hold between classicism and romanticism!But he was not sufficiently primitive to live three hundred years, and 'tis a pity.His absence is a void which is but too sensibly felt to-day.Moreover, for the purpose of thus following passers-by (and especially female passers-by) in the streets, which Gringoire was fond of doing, there is no better disposition than ignorance of where one is going to sleep.So he walked along, very thoughtfully, behind the young girl, who hastened her pace and made her goat trot as she saw the bourgeois returning home and the taverns--the only shops which had been open that day--closing.\"After all,\" he half thought to himself, \"she must lodge somewhere; gypsies have kindly hearts.Who knows?--\"  And in the points of suspense which he placed after this reticence in his mind, there lay I know not what flattering ideas.Meanwhile, from time to time, as he passed the last groups of bourgeois closing their doors, he caught some scraps of their conversation, which broke the thread of his pleasant hypotheses.Now it was two old men accosting each other.\"Do you know that it is cold, Master Thibaut Fernicle?\" (Gringoire had been aware of this since the beginning of the winter.)\"Yes, indeed, Master Boniface Disome!Are we going to have a winter such as we had three years ago, in '80, when wood cost eight sous the measure?\"\"Bah!that's nothing, Master Thibaut, compared with the winter of 1407, when it froze from St. Martin's Day until Candlemas!and so cold that the pen of the registrar of the parliament froze every three words, in the Grand Chamber!which interrupted the registration of justice.\"Further on there were two female neighbors at their windows, holding candles, which the fog caused to sputter.\"Has your husband told you about the mishap, Mademoiselle la Boudraque?\"\"No.What is it, Mademoiselle Turquant?\"\"The horse of M. Gilles Godin, the notary at the Chatelet, took fright at the Flemings and their procession, and overturned Master Philippe Avrillot, lay monk of the Celestins.\"\"Really?\"\"Actually.\"\"A bourgeois horse! 'tis rather too much!If it had been a cavalry horse, well and good!\"And the windows were closed.But Gringoire had lost the thread of his ideas, nevertheless.Fortunately, he speedily found it again, and he knotted it together without difficulty, thanks to the gypsy, thanks to Djali, who still walked in front of him; two fine, delicate, and charming creatures, whose tiny feet, beautiful forms, and graceful manners he was engaged in admiring, almost confusing them in his contemplation; believing them to be both young girls, from their intelligence and good friendship; regarding them both as goats,--so far as the lightness, agility, and dexterity of their walk were concerned.But the streets were becoming blacker and more deserted every moment.The curfew had sounded long ago, and it was only at rare intervals now that they encountered a passer-by in the street, or a light in the windows.Gringoire had become involved, in his pursuit of the gypsy, in that inextricable labyrinth of alleys, squares, and closed courts which surround the ancient sepulchre of the Saints-Innocents, and which resembles a ball of thread tangled by a cat. \"Here are streets which possess but little logic!\"said Gringoire, lost in the thousands of circuits which returned upon themselves incessantly, but where the young girl pursued a road which seemed familiar to her, without hesitation and with a step which became ever more rapid.As for him, he would have been utterly ignorant of his situation had he not espied, in passing, at the turn of a street, the octagonal mass of the pillory of the fish markets, the open-work summit of which threw its black, fretted outlines clearly upon a window which was still lighted in the Rue Verdelet.The young girl's attention had been attracted to him for the last few moments; she had repeatedly turned her head towards him with uneasiness; she had even once come to a standstill, and taking advantage of a ray of light which escaped from a half-open bakery to survey him intently, from head to foot, then, having cast this glance, Gringoire had seen her make that little pout which he had",

    "history": "Claude Frollo had been destined from infancy, by his parents, to the ecclesiastical profession.He had been taught to read in Latin; he had been trained to keep his eyes on the ground and to speak low.While still a child, his father had cloistered him in the college of Torchi in the University.There it was that he had grown up, on the missal and the lexicon.Moreover, he was a sad, grave, serious child, who studied ardently, and learned quickly; he never uttered a loud cry in recreation hour, mixed but little in the bacchanals of the Rue du Fouarre, did not know what it was to _dare alapas et capillos laniare_, and had cut no figure in that revolt of 1463, which the annalists register gravely, under the title of \"The sixth trouble of the University.\"He seldom rallied the poor students of Montaigu on the _cappettes_ from which they derived their name, or the bursars of the college of Dormans on their shaved tonsure, and their surtout parti- of bluish-green, blue, and violet cloth, _azurini coloris et bruni_, as says the charter of the Cardinal des Quatre-Couronnes.On the other hand, he was assiduous at the great and the small schools of the Rue Saint Jean de Beauvais.The first pupil whom the Abbe de Saint Pierre de Val, at the moment of beginning his reading on canon law, always perceived, glued to a pillar of the school Saint-Vendregesile, opposite his rostrum, was Claude Frollo, armed with his horn ink-bottle, biting his pen, scribbling on his threadbare knee, and, in winter, blowing on his fingers.The first auditor whom Messire Miles d'Isliers, doctor in decretals, saw arrive every Monday morning, all breathless, at the opening of the gates of the school of the Chef-Saint-Denis, was Claude Frollo.Thus, at sixteen years of age, the young clerk might have held his own, in mystical theology, against a father of the church; in canonical theology, against a father of the councils; in scholastic theology, against a doctor of Sorbonne.Theology conquered, he had plunged into decretals.From the \"Master of Sentences,\" he had passed to the \"Capitularies of Charlemagne;\" and he had devoured in succession, in his appetite for science, decretals upon decretals, those of Theodore, Bishop of Hispalus; those of Bouchard, Bishop of Worms; those of Yves, Bishop of Chartres; next the decretal of Gratian, which succeeded the capitularies of Charlemagne; then the collection of Gregory IX.;then the Epistle of _Superspecula_, of Honorius III.He rendered clear and familiar to himself that vast and tumultuous period of civil law and canon law in conflict and at strife with each other, in the chaos of the Middle Ages,--a period which Bishop Theodore opens in 618, and which Pope Gregory closes in 1227.Decretals digested, he flung himself upon medicine, on the liberal arts.He studied the science of herbs, the science of unguents; he became an expert in fevers and in contusions, in sprains and abcesses.Jacques d' Espars would have received him as a physician; Richard Hellain, as a surgeon.He also passed through all the degrees of licentiate, master, and doctor of arts.He studied the languages, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, a triple sanctuary then very little frequented.His was a veritable fever for acquiring and hoarding, in the matter of science.At the age of eighteen, he had made his way through the four faculties; it seemed to the young man that life had but one sole object: learning.It was towards this epoch, that the excessive heat of the summer of 1466 caused that grand outburst of the plague which carried off more than forty thousand souls in the vicomty of Paris, and among others, as Jean de Troyes states, \"Master Arnoul, astrologer to the king, who was a very fine man, both wise and pleasant.\"The rumor spread in the University that the Rue Tirechappe was especially devastated by the malady.It was there that Claude's parents resided, in the midst of their fief.The young scholar rushed in great alarm to the paternal mansion.When he entered it, he found that both father and mother had died on the preceding day.A very young brother of his, who was in swaddling clothes, was still alive and crying abandoned in his cradle.This was all that remained to Claude of his family; the young man took the child under his arm and went off in a pensive mood.Up to that moment, he had lived only in science; he now began to live in life.This catastrophe was a crisis in Claude's existence.",

    "history": "Aymoire relates that a stag, being chased by Dagobert, having taken refuge near the tomb of Saint-Denis, the pack of hounds stopped short and barked.Churches generally had a small apartment prepared for the reception of supplicants.In 1407, Nicolas Flamel caused to be built on the vaults of Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie, a chamber which cost him four livres six sous, sixteen farthings, parisis.At Notre-Dame it was a tiny cell situated on the roof of the side aisle, beneath the flying buttresses, precisely at the spot where the wife of the present janitor of the towers has made for herself a garden, which is to the hanging gardens of Babylon what a lettuce is to a palm-tree, what a porter's wife is to a Semiramis.It was here that Quasimodo had deposited la Esmeralda, after his wild and triumphant course.As long as that course lasted, the young girl had been unable to recover her senses, half unconscious, half awake, no longer feeling anything, except that she was mounting through the air, floating in it, flying in it, that something was raising her above the earth.From time to time she heard the loud laughter, the noisy voice of Quasimodo in her ear; she half opened her eyes; then below her she confusedly beheld Paris checkered with its thousand roofs of slate and tiles, like a red and blue mosaic, above her head the frightful and joyous face of Quasimodo.Then her eyelids drooped again; she thought that all was over, that they had executed her during her swoon, and that the misshapen spirit which had presided over her destiny, had laid hold of her and was bearing her away.She dared not look at him, and she surrendered herself to her fate.But when the bellringer, dishevelled and panting, had deposited her in the cell of refuge, when she felt his huge hands gently detaching the cord which bruised her arms, she felt that sort of shock which awakens with a start the passengers of a vessel which runs aground in the middle of a dark night.Her thoughts awoke also, and returned to her one by one.She saw that she was in Notre-Dame; she remembered having been torn from the hands of the executioner; that Phoebus was alive, that Phoebus loved her no longer; and as these two ideas, one of which shed so much bitterness over the other, presented themselves simultaneously to the poor condemned girl; she turned to Quasimodo, who was standing in front of her, and who terrified her; she said to him,--\"Why have you saved me?\"He gazed at her with anxiety, as though seeking to divine what she was saying to him.She repeated her question.Then he gave her a profoundly sorrowful glance and fled.She was astonished.A few moments later he returned, bearing a package which he cast at her feet.It was clothing which some charitable women had left on the threshold of the church for her.Then she dropped her eyes upon herself and saw that she was almost naked, and blushed.Life had returned.Quasimodo appeared to experience something of this modesty.He covered his eyes with his large hand and retired once more, but slowly.She made haste to dress herself.The robe was a white one with a white veil,--the garb of a novice of the Hotel-Dien.She had barely finished when she beheld Quasimodo returning.He carried a basket under one arm and a mattress under the other.In the basket there was a bottle, bread, and some provisions.He set the basket on the floor and said, \"Eat!\"He spread the mattress on the flagging and said, \"Sleep.\"It was his own repast, it was his own bed, which the bellringer had gone in search of.The gypsy raised her eyes to thank him, but she could not articulate a word.She dropped her head with a quiver of terror.Then he said to her.--  \"I frighten you.I am very ugly, am I not?Do not look at me; only listen to me.During the day you will remain here; at night you can walk all over the church.But do not leave the church either by day or by night.You would be lost.They would kill you, and I should die.\"She was touched and raised her head to answer him.He had disappeared.She found herself alone once more, meditating upon the singular words of this almost monstrous being, and struck by the sound of his voice, which was so hoarse yet so gentle.Then she examined her cell.It was a chamber about six feet square, with a small window and a door on the slightly sloping plane of the roof formed of flat stones.Many gutters with the figures of animals seemed to be bending down around her, and stretching their necks in order to stare at her through the window.Over the edge of her roof she perceived the tops of thousands of chimneys which caused the smoke of all the fires in Paris to rise beneath her eyes.A sad sight for the poor gypsy, a foundling, condemned to death, an unhappy creature, without country, without family, without a hearthstone.",

    "history": "She took care to dress herself in the morning in the corner of her cell for fear some inhabitants of the neighboring attics might see her through the window.When the thought of Phoebus left her time, the gypsy sometimes thought of Quasimodo.He was the sole bond, the sole connection, the sole communication which remained to her with men, with the living.Unfortunate girl!she was more outside the world than Quasimodo.She understood not in the least the strange friend whom chance had given her.She often reproached herself for not feeling a gratitude which should close her eyes, but decidedly, she could not accustom herself to the poor bellringer.He was too ugly.She had left the whistle which he had given her lying on the ground.This did not prevent Quasimodo from making his appearance from time to time during the first few days.She did her best not to turn aside with too much repugnance when he came to bring her her basket of provisions or her jug of water, but he always perceived the slightest movement of this sort, and then he withdrew sadly.Once he came at the moment when she was caressing Djali.He stood pensively for several minutes before this graceful group of the goat and the gypsy; at last he said, shaking his heavy and ill-formed head,--  \"My misfortune is that I still resemble a man too much.I should like to be wholly a beast like that goat.\"She gazed at him in amazement.He replied to the glance,--  \"Oh!I well know why,\" and he went away.On another occasion he presented himself at the door of the cell (which he never entered) at the moment when la Esmeralda was singing an old Spanish ballad, the words of which she did not understand, but which had lingered in her ear because the gypsy women had lulled her to sleep with it when she was a little child.At the sight of that villanous form which made its appearance so abruptly in the middle of her song, the young girl paused with an involuntary gesture of alarm.The unhappy bellringer fell upon his knees on the threshold, and clasped his large, misshapen hands with a suppliant air. \"Oh!\"he said, sorrowfully, \"continue, I implore you, and do not drive me away.\"She did not wish to pain him, and resumed her lay, trembling all over.By degrees, however, her terror disappeared, and she yielded herself wholly to the slow and melancholy air which she was singing.He remained on his knees with hands clasped, as in prayer, attentive, hardly breathing, his gaze riveted upon the gypsy's brilliant eyes.On another occasion, he came to her with an awkward and timid air.\"Listen,\" he said, with an effort; \"I have something to say to you.\"She made him a sign that she was listening.Then he began to sigh, half opened his lips, appeared for a moment to be on the point of speaking, then he looked at her again, shook his head, and withdrew slowly, with his brow in his hand, leaving the gypsy stupefied.Among the grotesque personages sculptured on the wall, there was one to whom he was particularly attached, and with which he often seemed to exchange fraternal glances.Once the gypsy heard him saying to it,--  \"Oh!why am not I of stone, like you!\"At last, one morning, la Esmeralda had advanced to the edge of the roof, and was looking into the Place over the pointed roof of Saint-Jean le Rond.Quasimodo was standing behind her.He had placed himself in that position in order to spare the young girl, as far as possible, the displeasure of seeing him.All at once the gypsy started, a tear and a flash of joy gleamed simultaneously in her eyes, she knelt on the brink of the roof and extended her arms towards the Place with anguish, exclaiming: \"Phoebus!come!come!a word, a single word in the name of heaven!Phoebus!Phoebus!\"Her voice, her face, her gesture, her whole person bore the heartrending expression of a shipwrecked man who is making a signal of distress to the joyous vessel which is passing afar off in a ray of sunlight on the horizon.Quasimodo leaned over the Place, and saw that the object of this tender and agonizing prayer was a young man, a captain, a handsome cavalier all glittering with arms and decorations, prancing across the end of the Place, and saluting with his plume a beautiful lady who was smiling at him from her balcony.However, the officer did not hear the unhappy girl calling him; he was too far away.But the poor deaf man heard.A profound sigh heaved his breast; he turned round; his heart was swollen with all the tears which he was swallowing; his convulsively-clenched fists struck against his head, and when he withdrew them there was a bunch of red hair in each hand.The gypsy paid no heed to him.He said in a low voice as he gnashed his teeth,--  \"Damnation!That is what one should be like! 'Tis only necessary to be handsome on the outside!\"Meanwhile, she remained kneeling",

    "snippet_former_context": "It was peopled with marble figures,--kings, saints, bishops,--who at least did not burst out laughing in his face, and who gazed upon him only with tranquillity and kindliness.The other statues, those of the monsters and demons, cherished no hatred for him, Quasimodo.He resembled them too much for that.They seemed rather, to be scoffing at other men.The saints were his friends, and blessed him; the monsters were his friends and guarded him.So he held long communion with them.He sometimes passed whole hours crouching before one of these statues, in solitary conversation with it.If any one came, he fled like a lover surprised in his serenade.And the cathedral was not only society for him, but the universe, and all nature beside.",

    "history": "The rough and wrinkled cathedral was his shell.It is useless to warn the reader not to take literally all the similes which we are obliged to employ here to express the singular, symmetrical, direct, almost consubstantial union of a man and an edifice.It is equally unnecessary to state to what a degree that whole cathedral was familiar to him, after so long and so intimate a cohabitation.That dwelling was peculiar to him.It had no depths to which Quasimodo had not penetrated, no height which he had not scaled.He often climbed many stones up the front, aided solely by the uneven points of the carving.The towers, on whose exterior surface he was frequently seen clambering, like a lizard gliding along a perpendicular wall, those two gigantic twins, so lofty, so menacing, so formidable, possessed for him neither vertigo, nor terror, nor shocks of amazement.To see them so gentle under his hand, so easy to scale, one would have said that he had tamed them.By dint of leaping, climbing, gambolling amid the abysses of the gigantic cathedral he had become, in some sort, a monkey and a goat, like the Calabrian child who swims before he walks, and plays with the sea while still a babe.Moreover, it was not his body alone which seemed fashioned after the Cathedral, but his mind also.In what condition was that mind?What bent had it contracted, what form had it assumed beneath that knotted envelope, in that savage life?This it would be hard to determine.Quasimodo had been born one-eyed, hunchbacked, lame.It was with great difficulty, and by dint of great patience that Claude Frollo had succeeded in teaching him to talk.But a fatality was attached to the poor foundling.Bellringer of Notre-Dame at the age of fourteen, a new infirmity had come to complete his misfortunes: the bells had broken the drums of his ears; he had become deaf.The only gate which nature had left wide open for him had been abruptly closed, and forever.In closing, it had cut off the only ray of joy and of light which still made its way into the soul of Quasimodo.His soul fell into profound night.The wretched being's misery became as incurable and as complete as his deformity.Let us add that his deafness rendered him to some extent dumb.For, in order not to make others laugh, the very moment that he found himself to be deaf, he resolved upon a silence which he only broke when he was alone.He voluntarily tied that tongue which Claude Frollo had taken so much pains to unloose.Hence, it came about, that when necessity constrained him to speak, his tongue was torpid, awkward, and like a door whose hinges have grown rusty.If now we were to try to penetrate to the soul of Quasimodo through that thick, hard rind; if we could sound the depths of that badly constructed organism; if it were granted to us to look with a torch behind those non-transparent organs to explore the shadowy interior of that opaque creature, to elucidate his obscure corners, his absurd no-thoroughfares, and suddenly to cast a vivid light upon the soul enchained at the extremity of that cave, we should, no doubt, find the unhappy Psyche in some poor, cramped, and ricketty attitude, like those prisoners beneath the Leads of Venice, who grew old bent double in a stone box which was both too low and too short for them.It is certain that the mind becomes atrophied in a defective body.Quasimodo was barely conscious of a soul cast in his own image, moving blindly within him.The impressions of objects underwent a considerable refraction before reaching his mind.His brain was a peculiar medium; the ideas which passed through it issued forth completely distorted.The reflection which resulted from this refraction was, necessarily, divergent and perverted.Hence a thousand optical illusions, a thousand aberrations of judgment, a thousand deviations, in which his thought strayed, now mad, now idiotic.The first effect of this fatal organization was to trouble the glance which he cast upon things.He received hardly any immediate perception of them.The external world seemed much farther away to him than it does to us.The second effect of his misfortune was to render him malicious.He was malicious, in fact, because he was savage; he was savage because he was ugly.There was logic in his nature, as there is in ours.His strength, so extraordinarily developed, was a cause of still greater malevolence: \"_Malus puer robustus_,\" says Hobbes.This justice must, however be rendered to him.Malevolence was not, perhaps, innate in him.From his very first steps among men, he had felt himself, later on he had seen himself, spewed out, blasted, rejected.Human words were, for him, always a raillery or a malediction.As he grew up, he had found nothing but hatred around him.He had caught the general malevolence.He had picked up the weapon with which he had been wounded.After all, he turned his face towards men only with reluctance; his cathedral was sufficient for him.",

    "history": "The giant shadow of the towers leaped from roof to roof, from one end of the great city to the other.There were several quarters from which were already heard voices and noisy sounds.Here the stroke of a bell, there the stroke of a hammer, beyond, the complicated clatter of a cart in motion.Already several columns of smoke were being belched forth from the chimneys scattered over the whole surface of roofs, as through the fissures of an immense sulphurous crater.The river, which ruffles its waters against the arches of so many bridges, against the points of so many islands, was wavering with silvery folds.Around the city, outside the ramparts, sight was lost in a great circle of fleecy vapors through which one confusedly distinguished the indefinite line of the plains, and the graceful swell of the heights.All sorts of floating sounds were dispersed over this half-awakened city.Towards the east, the morning breeze chased a few soft white bits of wool torn from the misty fleece of the hills.In the Parvis, some good women, who had their milk jugs in their hands, were pointing out to each other, with astonishment, the singular dilapidation of the great door of Notre-Dame, and the two solidified streams of lead in the crevices of the stone.This was all that remained of the tempest of the night.The bonfire lighted between the towers by Quasimodo had died out.Tristan had already cleared up the Place, and had the dead thrown into the Seine.Kings like Louis XI.are careful to clean the pavement quickly after a massacre.Outside the balustrade of the tower, directly under the point where the priest had paused, there was one of those fantastically carved stone gutters with which Gothic edifices bristle, and, in a crevice of that gutter, two pretty wallflowers in blossom, shaken out and vivified, as it were, by the breath of air, made frolicsome salutations to each other.Above the towers, on high, far away in the depths of the sky, the cries of little birds were heard.But the priest was not listening to, was not looking at, anything of all this.He was one of the men for whom there are no mornings, no birds, no flowers.In that immense horizon, which assumed so many aspects about him, his contemplation was concentrated on a single point.Quasimodo was burning to ask him what he had done with the gypsy; but the archdeacon seemed to be out of the world at that moment.He was evidently in one of those violent moments of life when one would not feel the earth crumble.He remained motionless and silent, with his eyes steadily fixed on a certain point; and there was something so terrible about this silence and immobility that the savage bellringer shuddered before it and dared not come in contact with it.Only, and this was also one way of interrogating the archdeacon, he followed the direction of his vision, and in this way the glance of the unhappy deaf man fell upon the Place de Greve.Thus he saw what the priest was looking at.The ladder was erected near the permanent gallows.There were some people and many soldiers in the Place.A man was dragging a white thing, from which hung something black, along the pavement.This man halted at the foot of the gallows.Here something took place which Quasimodo could not see very clearly.It was not because his only eye had not preserved its long range, but there was a group of soldiers which prevented his seeing everything.Moreover, at that moment the sun appeared, and such a flood of light overflowed the horizon that one would have said that all the points in Paris, spires, chimneys, gables, had simultaneously taken fire.Meanwhile, the man began to mount the ladder.Then Quasimodo saw him again distinctly.He was carrying a woman on his shoulder, a young girl dressed in white; that young girl had a noose about her neck.Quasimodo recognized her.It was she.The man reached the top of the ladder.There he arranged the noose.Here the priest, in order to see the better, knelt upon the balustrade.All at once the man kicked away the ladder abruptly, and Quasimodo, who had not breathed for several moments, beheld the unhappy child dangling at the end of the rope two fathoms above the pavement, with the man squatting on her shoulders.The rope made several gyrations on itself, and Quasimodo beheld horrible convulsions run along the gypsy's body.The priest, on his side, with outstretched neck and eyes starting from his head, contemplated this horrible group of the man and the young girl,--the spider and the fly.At the moment when it was most horrible, the laugh of a demon, a laugh which one can only give vent to when one is no longer human, burst forth on the priest's livid face.Quasimodo did not hear that laugh, but he saw it.The bellringer retreated several paces behind the archdeacon, and suddenly hurling himself upon him with fury, with his huge hands he pushed him by the back over into the abyss over",

    "history": "It was Chopin Trouillefou.A shot from an arquebus laid him low.In the meantime, windows had been opened again.The neighbors hearing the war cries of the king's troops, had mingled in the affray, and bullets rained upon the outcasts from every story.The Parvis was filled with a thick smoke, which the musketry streaked with flame.Through it one could confusedly distinguish the front of Notre-Dame, and the decrepit Hotel-Dieu with some wan invalids gazing down from the heights of its roof all checkered with dormer windows.At length the vagabonds gave way.Weariness, the lack of good weapons, the fright of this surprise, the musketry from the windows, the valiant attack of the king's troops, all overwhelmed them.They forced the line of assailants, and fled in every direction, leaving the Parvis encumbered with dead.When Quasimodo, who had not ceased to fight for a moment, beheld this rout, he fell on his knees and raised his hands to heaven; then, intoxicated with joy, he ran, he ascended with the swiftness of a bird to that cell, the approaches to which he had so intrepidly defended.He had but one thought now; it was to kneel before her whom he had just saved for the second time.When he entered the cell, he found it empty.BOOK ELEVENTH.CHAPTER I. THE LITTLE SHOE.La Esmeralda was sleeping at the moment when the outcasts assailed the church.Soon the ever-increasing uproar around the edifice, and the uneasy bleating of her goat which had been awakened, had roused her from her slumbers.She had sat up, she had listened, she had looked; then, terrified by the light and noise, she had rushed from her cell to see.The aspect of the Place, the vision which was moving in it, the disorder of that nocturnal assault, that hideous crowd, leaping like a cloud of frogs, half seen in the gloom, the croaking of that hoarse multitude, those few red torches running and crossing each other in the darkness like the meteors which streak the misty surfaces of marshes, this whole scene produced upon her the effect of a mysterious battle between the phantoms of the witches' sabbath and the stone monsters of the church.Imbued from her very infancy with the superstitions of the Bohemian tribe, her first thought was that she had caught the strange beings peculiar to the night, in their deeds of witchcraft.Then she ran in terror to cower in her cell, asking of her pallet some less terrible nightmare.But little by little the first vapors of terror had been dissipated; from the constantly increasing noise, and from many other signs of reality, she felt herself besieged not by spectres, but by human beings.Then her fear, though it did not increase, changed its character.She had dreamed of the possibility of a popular mutiny to tear her from her asylum.The idea of once more recovering life, hope, Phoebus, who was ever present in her future, the extreme helplessness of her condition, flight cut off, no support, her abandonment, her isolation,--these thoughts and a thousand others overwhelmed her.She fell upon her knees, with her head on her bed, her hands clasped over her head, full of anxiety and tremors, and, although a gypsy, an idolater, and a pagan, she began to entreat with sobs, mercy from the good Christian God, and to pray to our Lady, her hostess.For even if one believes in nothing, there are moments in life when one is always of the religion of the temple which is nearest at hand.She remained thus prostrate for a very long time, trembling in truth, more than praying, chilled by the ever-closer breath of that furious multitude, understanding nothing of this outburst, ignorant of what was being plotted, what was being done, what they wanted, but foreseeing a terrible issue.In the midst of this anguish, she heard some one walking near her.She turned round.Two men, one of whom carried a lantern, had just entered her cell.She uttered a feeble cry.\"Fear nothing,\" said a voice which was not unknown to her, \"it is I.\"  \"Who are you?\"she asked.\"Pierre Gringoire.\"This name reassured her.She raised her eyes once more, and recognized the poet in very fact.But there stood beside him a black figure veiled from head to foot, which struck her by its silence.\"Oh!\"continued Gringoire in a tone of reproach, \"Djali recognized me before you!\"The little goat had not, in fact, waited for Gringoire to announce his name.No sooner had he entered than it rubbed itself gently against his knees, covering the poet with caresses and with white hairs, for it was shedding its hair.Gringoire returned the caresses.\"Who is this with you?\"said the gypsy, in a low voice.\"Be at ease,\" replied Gringoire. \"'Tis one of my friends.\"",

    "history": "She raised her head, and beheld a ray of reddish light passing through the crevices in the sort of trapdoor contrived in the roof of the _inpace_.At the same time, the heavy lock creaked, the trap grated on its rusty hinges, turned, and she beheld a lantern, a hand, and the lower portions of the bodies of two men, the door being too low to admit of her seeing their heads.The light pained her so acutely that she shut her eyes.When she opened them again the door was closed, the lantern was deposited on one of the steps of the staircase; a man alone stood before her.A monk's black cloak fell to his feet, a cowl of the same color concealed his face.Nothing was visible of his person, neither face nor hands.It was a long, black shroud standing erect, and beneath which something could be felt moving.She gazed fixedly for several minutes at this sort of spectre.But neither he nor she spoke.One would have pronounced them two statues confronting each other.Two things only seemed alive in that cavern; the wick of the lantern, which sputtered on account of the dampness of the atmosphere, and the drop of water from the roof, which cut this irregular sputtering with its monotonous splash, and made the light of the lantern quiver in concentric waves on the oily water of the pool.At last the prisoner broke the silence.\"Who are you?\"\"A priest.\"The words, the accent, the sound of his voice made her tremble.The priest continued, in a hollow voice,--  \"Are you prepared?\"\"For what?\"\"To die.\"\"Oh!\"said she, \"will it be soon?\"\"To-morrow.\"Her head, which had been raised with joy, fell back upon her breast.\"'Tis very far away yet!\"she murmured; \"why could they not have done it to-day?\"\"Then you are very unhappy?\"asked the priest, after a silence.\"I am very cold,\" she replied.She took her feet in her hands, a gesture habitual with unhappy wretches who are cold, as we have already seen in the case of the recluse of the Tour-Roland, and her teeth chattered.The priest appeared to cast his eyes around the dungeon from beneath his cowl.\"Without light!without fire!in the water!it is horrible!\"\"Yes,\" she replied, with the bewildered air which unhappiness had given her. \"The day belongs to every one, why do they give me only night?\"\"Do you know,\" resumed the priest, after a fresh silence, \"why you are here?\"\"I thought I knew once,\" she said, passing her thin fingers over her eyelids, as though to aid her memory, \"but I know no longer.\"All at once she began to weep like a child.\"I should like to get away from here, sir.I am cold, I am afraid, and there are creatures which crawl over my body.\"\"Well, follow me.\"So saying, the priest took her arm.The unhappy girl was frozen to her very soul.Yet that hand produced an impression of cold upon her.\"Oh!\"she murmured, \"'tis the icy hand of death.Who are you?\"The priest threw back his cowl; she looked.It was the sinister visage which had so long pursued her; that demon's head which had appeared at la Falourdel's, above the head of her adored Phoebus; that eye which she last had seen glittering beside a dagger.This apparition, always so fatal for her, and which had thus driven her on from misfortune to misfortune, even to torture, roused her from her stupor.It seemed to her that the sort of veil which had lain thick upon her memory was rent away.All the details of her melancholy adventure, from the nocturnal scene at la Falourdel's to her condemnation to the Tournelle, recurred to her memory, no longer vague and confused as heretofore, but distinct, harsh, clear, palpitating, terrible.These souvenirs, half effaced and almost obliterated by excess of suffering, were revived by the sombre figure which stood before her, as the approach of fire causes letters traced upon white paper with invisible ink, to start out perfectly fresh.It seemed to her that all the wounds of her heart opened and bled simultaneously.\"Hah!\"she cried, with her hands on her eyes, and a convulsive trembling, \"'tis the priest!\"Then she dropped her arms in discouragement, and remained seated, with lowered head, eyes fixed on the ground, mute and still trembling.The priest gazed at her with the eye of a hawk which has long been soaring in a circle from the heights of heaven over a poor lark cowering in the wheat, and has long been silently contracting the formidable circles of his flight, and has suddenly swooped down upon his prey like a flash of lightning, and holds it panting in his talons.She began to murmur in a low voice,--  \"Finish!finish!the last blow!\"and she drew her head down in terror between her shoulders, like the lamb awaiting the blow of the butcher's axe.",

    "history": "The entrance of King Charles VII.,when, also, there were many people.I no longer remember in what year that was.When I speak of this to you, it produces upon you the effect,--does it not?--the effect of something very old, and upon me of something very young.Oh!the crowd was far finer than at the present day.They even stood upon the machicolations of the Porte Sainte-Antoine.The king had the queen on a pillion, and after their highnesses came all the ladies mounted behind all the lords.I remember that they laughed loudly, because beside Amanyon de Garlande, who was very short of stature, there rode the Sire Matefelon, a chevalier of gigantic size, who had killed heaps of English.It was very fine.A procession of all the gentlemen of France, with their oriflammes waving red before the eye.There were some with pennons and some with banners.How can I tell?the Sire de Calm with a pennon; Jean de Chateaumorant with a banner; the Sire de Courcy with a banner, and a more ample one than any of the others except the Duc de Bourbon.Alas! 'tis a sad thing to think that all that has existed and exists no longer!\"The two lovers were not listening to the venerable dowager.Phoebus had returned and was leaning on the back of his betrothed's chair, a charming post whence his libertine glance plunged into all the openings of Fleur-de-Lys's gorget.This gorget gaped so conveniently, and allowed him to see so many exquisite things and to divine so many more, that Phoebus, dazzled by this skin with its gleams of satin, said to himself, \"How can any one love anything but a fair skin?\"Both were silent.The young girl raised sweet, enraptured eyes to him from time to time, and their hair mingled in a ray of spring sunshine.\"Phoebus,\" said Fleur-de-Lys suddenly, in a low voice, \"we are to be married three months hence; swear to me that you have never loved any other woman than myself.\"\"I swear it, fair angel!\"replied Phoebus, and his passionate glances aided the sincere tone of his voice in convincing Fleur-de-Lys.Meanwhile, the good mother, charmed to see the betrothed pair on terms of such perfect understanding, had just quitted the apartment to attend to some domestic matter; Phoebus observed it, and this so emboldened the adventurous captain that very strange ideas mounted to his brain.Fleur-de-Lys loved him, he was her betrothed; she was alone with him; his former taste for her had re-awakened, not with all its fresh-ness but with all its ardor; after all, there is no great harm in tasting one's wheat while it is still in the blade; I do not know whether these ideas passed through his mind, but one thing is certain, that Fleur-de-Lys was suddenly alarmed by the expression of his glance.She looked round and saw that her mother was no longer there.\"Good heavens!\"said she, blushing and uneasy, \"how very warm I am?\"\"I think, in fact,\" replied Phoebus, \"that it cannot be far from midday.The sun is troublesome.We need only lower the curtains.\"\"No, no,\" exclaimed the poor little thing, \"on the contrary, I need air.\"And like a fawn who feels the breath of the pack of hounds, she rose, ran to the window, opened it, and rushed upon the balcony.Phoebus, much discomfited, followed her.The Place du Parvis Notre-Dame, upon which the balcony looked, as the reader knows, presented at that moment a singular and sinister spectacle which caused the fright of the timid Fleur-de-Lys to change its nature.An immense crowd, which overflowed into all the neighboring streets, encumbered the Place, properly speaking.The little wall, breast high, which surrounded the Place, would not have sufficed to keep it free had it not been lined with a thick hedge of sergeants and hackbuteers, culverines in hand.Thanks to this thicket of pikes and arquebuses, the Parvis was empty.Its entrance was guarded by a force of halberdiers with the armorial bearings of the bishop.The large doors of the church were closed, and formed a contrast with the innumerable windows on the Place, which, open to their very gables, allowed a view of thousands of heads heaped up almost like the piles of bullets in a park of artillery.The surface of this rabble was dingy, dirty, earthy.The spectacle which it was expecting was evidently one of the sort which possess the privilege of bringing out and calling together the vilest among the populace.Nothing is so hideous as the noise which was made by that swarm of yellow caps and dirty heads.In that throng there were more laughs than cries, more women than men.From time to time, a sharp and vibrating voice pierced the general clamor.",

    "history": "Let the reader picture to himself in bacchanal form, Salvator Rosa's battle.There were no longer either scholars or ambassadors or bourgeois or men or women; there was no longer any Clopin Trouillefou, nor Gilles Lecornu, nor Marie Quatrelivres, nor Robin Poussepain.All was universal license.The grand hall was no longer anything but a vast furnace of effrontry and joviality, where every mouth was a cry, every individual a posture; everything shouted and howled.The strange visages which came, in turn, to gnash their teeth in the rose window, were like so many brands cast into the brazier; and from the whole of this effervescing crowd, there escaped, as from a furnace, a sharp, piercing, stinging noise, hissing like the wings of a gnat.\"Ho he!curse it!\"\"Just look at that face!\"\"It's not good for anything.\"\"Guillemette Maugerepuis, just look at that bull's muzzle; it only lacks the horns.It can't be your husband.\"\"Another!\"\"Belly of the pope!what sort of a grimace is that?\"\"Hola he!that's cheating.One must show only one's face.\"\"That damned Perrette Callebotte!she's capable of that!\"\"Good!Good!\"\"I'm stifling!\"\"There's a fellow whose ears won't go through!\"Etc.,etc.But we must do justice to our friend Jehan.In the midst of this witches' sabbath, he was still to be seen on the top of his pillar, like the cabin-boy on the topmast.He floundered about with incredible fury.His mouth was wide open, and from it there escaped a cry which no one heard, not that it was covered by the general clamor, great as that was but because it attained, no doubt, the limit of perceptible sharp sounds, the thousand vibrations of Sauveur, or the eight thousand of Biot.As for Gringoire, the first moment of depression having passed, he had regained his composure.He had hardened himself against adversity.---\"Continue!\"he had said for the third time, to his comedians, speaking machines; then as he was marching with great strides in front of the marble table, a fancy seized him to go and appear in his turn at the aperture of the chapel, were it only for the pleasure of making a grimace at that ungrateful populace.--\"But no, that would not be worthy of us; no, vengeance!let us combat until the end,\" he repeated to himself; \"the power of poetry over people is great; I will bring them back.We shall see which will carry the day, grimaces or polite literature.\"Alas!he had been left the sole spectator of his piece.It was far worse than it had been a little while before.He no longer beheld anything but backs.I am mistaken.The big, patient man, whom he had already consulted in a critical moment, had remained with his face turned towards the stage.As for Gisquette and Lienarde, they had deserted him long ago.Gringoire was touched to the heart by the fidelity of his only spectator.He approached him and addressed him, shaking his arm slightly; for the good man was leaning on the balustrade and dozing a little.\"Monsieur,\" said Gringoire, \"I thank you!\"\"Monsieur,\" replied the big man with a yawn, \"for what?\"\"I see what wearies you,\" resumed the poet; \"'tis all this noise which prevents your hearing comfortably.But be at ease!your name shall descend to posterity!Your name, if you please?\"\"Renauld Chateau, guardian of the seals of the Chatelet of Paris, at your service.\"\"Monsieur, you are the only representative of the muses here,\" said Gringoire.\"You are too kind, sir,\" said the guardian of the seals at the Chatelet.\"You are the only one,\" resumed Gringoire, \"who has listened to the piece decorously.What do you think of it?\"\"He!he!\"replied the fat magistrate, half aroused, \"it's tolerably jolly, that's a fact.\"Gringoire was forced to content himself with this eulogy; for a thunder of applause, mingled with a prodigious acclamation, cut their conversation short.The Pope of the Fools had been elected.\"Noel!Noel!Noel!\"*shouted the people on all sides.That was, in fact, a marvellous grimace which was beaming at that moment through the aperture in the rose window.After all the pentagonal, hexagonal, and whimsical faces, which had succeeded each other at that hole without realizing the ideal of the grotesque which their imaginations, excited by the orgy, had constructed, nothing less was needed to win their suffrages than the sublime grimace which had just dazzled the assembly.Master Coppenole himself applauded, and Clopin Trouillefou, who had been among the competitors (and God knows what intensity of ugliness his visage could attain), confessed himself conquered:",

    "history": "A few moments later our poet found himself in a tiny arched chamber, very cosy, very warm, seated at a table which appeared to ask nothing better than to make some loans from a larder hanging near by, having a good bed in prospect, and alone with a pretty girl.The adventure smacked of enchantment.He began seriously to take himself for a personage in a fairy tale; he cast his eyes about him from time to time to time, as though to see if the chariot of fire, harnessed to two-winged chimeras, which alone could have so rapidly transported him from Tartarus to Paradise, were still there.At times, also, he fixed his eyes obstinately upon the holes in his doublet, in order to cling to reality, and not lose the ground from under his feet completely.His reason, tossed about in imaginary space, now hung only by this thread.The young girl did not appear to pay any attention to him; she went and came, displaced a stool, talked to her goat, and indulged in a pout now and then.At last she came and seated herself near the table, and Gringoire was able to scrutinize her at his ease.You have been a child, reader, and you would, perhaps, be very happy to be one still.It is quite certain that you have not, more than once (and for my part, I have passed whole days, the best employed of my life, at it) followed from thicket to thicket, by the side of running water, on a sunny day, a beautiful green or blue dragon-fly, breaking its flight in abrupt angles, and kissing the tips of all the branches.You recollect with what amorous curiosity your thought and your gaze were riveted upon this little whirlwind, hissing and humming with wings of purple and azure, in the midst of which floated an imperceptible body, veiled by the very rapidity of its movement.The aerial being which was dimly outlined amid this quivering of wings, appeared to you chimerical, imaginary, impossible to touch, impossible to see.But when, at length, the dragon-fly alighted on the tip of a reed, and, holding your breath the while, you were able to examine the long, gauze wings, the long enamel robe, the two globes of crystal, what astonishment you felt, and what fear lest you should again behold the form disappear into a shade, and the creature into a chimera!Recall these impressions, and you will readily appreciate what Gringoire felt on contemplating, beneath her visible and palpable form, that Esmeralda of whom, up to that time, he had only caught a glimpse, amidst a whirlwind of dance, song, and tumult.Sinking deeper and deeper into his revery: \"So this,\" he said to himself, following her vaguely with his eyes, \"is la Esmeralda!a celestial creature!a street dancer!so much, and so little! 'Twas she who dealt the death-blow to my mystery this morning, 'tis she who saves my life this evening!My evil genius!My good angel!A pretty woman, on my word!and who must needs love me madly to have taken me in that fashion.By the way,\" said he, rising suddenly, with that sentiment of the true which formed the foundation of his character and his philosophy, \"I don't know very well how it happens, but I am her husband!\"With this idea in his head and in his eyes, he stepped up to the young girl in a manner so military and so gallant that she drew back.\"What do you want of me?\"said she.\"Can you ask me, adorable Esmeralda?\"replied Gringoire, with so passionate an accent that he was himself astonished at it on hearing himself speak.The gypsy opened her great eyes. \"I don't know what you mean.\"\"What!\"resumed Gringoire, growing warmer and warmer, and supposing that, after all, he had to deal merely with a virtue of the Cour des Miracles; \"am I not thine, sweet friend, art thou not mine?\"And, quite ingenuously, he clasped her waist.The gypsy's corsage slipped through his hands like the skin of an eel.She bounded from one end of the tiny room to the other, stooped down, and raised herself again, with a little poniard in her hand, before Gringoire had even had time to see whence the poniard came; proud and angry, with swelling lips and inflated nostrils, her cheeks as red as an api apple,* and her eyes darting lightnings.At the same time, the white goat placed itself in front of her, and presented to Gringoire a hostile front, bristling with two pretty horns, gilded and very sharp.All this took place in the twinkling of an eye.*  A small dessert apple, bright red on one side and      greenish-white on the other.The dragon-fly had turned into a wasp, and asked nothing better than to sting.Our philosopher was speechless, and turned his astonished eyes from the goat to the young girl. \"Holy Virgin!\"he said at last, when surprise permitted him to speak, \"here are",

    "history": "He pitied her for the trouble that she was about to suffer.After these first caresses, he shouted to his assistants, placed in the lower story of the tower, to begin.They grasped the ropes, the wheel creaked, the enormous capsule of metal started slowly into motion.Quasimodo followed it with his glance and trembled.The first shock of the clapper and the brazen wall made the framework upon which it was mounted quiver.Quasimodo vibrated with the bell.\"Vah!\"he cried, with a senseless burst of laughter.However, the movement of the bass was accelerated, and, in proportion as it described a wider angle, Quasimodo's eye opened also more and more widely, phosphoric and flaming.At length the grand peal began; the whole tower trembled; woodwork, leads, cut stones, all groaned at once, from the piles of the foundation to the trefoils of its summit.Then Quasimodo boiled and frothed; he went and came; he trembled from head to foot with the tower.The bell, furious, running riot, presented to the two walls of the tower alternately its brazen throat, whence escaped that tempestuous breath, which is audible leagues away.Quasimodo stationed himself in front of this open throat; he crouched and rose with the oscillations of the bell, breathed in this overwhelming breath, gazed by turns at the deep place, which swarmed with people, two hundred feet below him, and at that enormous, brazen tongue which came, second after second, to howl in his ear.It was the only speech which he understood, the only sound which broke for him the universal silence.He swelled out in it as a bird does in the sun.All of a sudden, the frenzy of the bell seized upon him; his look became extraordinary; he lay in wait for the great bell as it passed, as a spider lies in wait for a fly, and flung himself abruptly upon it, with might and main.Then, suspended above the abyss, borne to and fro by the formidable swinging of the bell, he seized the brazen monster by the ear-laps, pressed it between both knees, spurred it on with his heels, and redoubled the fury of the peal with the whole shock and weight of his body.Meanwhile, the tower trembled; he shrieked and gnashed his teeth, his red hair rose erect, his breast heaving like a bellows, his eye flashed flames, the monstrous bell neighed, panting, beneath him; and then it was no longer the great bell of Notre-Dame nor Quasimodo: it was a dream, a whirlwind, a tempest, dizziness mounted astride of noise; a spirit clinging to a flying crupper, a strange centaur, half man, half bell; a sort of horrible Astolphus, borne away upon a prodigious hippogriff of living bronze.The presence of this extraordinary being caused, as it were, a breath of life to circulate throughout the entire cathedral.It seemed as though there escaped from him, at least according to the growing superstitions of the crowd, a mysterious emanation which animated all the stones of Notre-Dame, and made the deep bowels of the ancient church to palpitate.It sufficed for people to know that he was there, to make them believe that they beheld the thousand statues of the galleries and the fronts in motion.And the cathedral did indeed seem a docile and obedient creature beneath his hand; it waited on his will to raise its great voice; it was possessed and filled with Quasimodo, as with a familiar spirit.One would have said that he made the immense edifice breathe.He was everywhere about it; in fact, he multiplied himself on all points of the structure.Now one perceived with affright at the very top of one of the towers, a fantastic dwarf climbing, writhing, crawling on all fours, descending outside above the abyss, leaping from projection to projection, and going to ransack the belly of some sculptured gorgon; it was Quasimodo dislodging the crows.Again, in some obscure corner of the church one came in contact with a sort of living chimera, crouching and scowling; it was Quasimodo engaged in thought.Sometimes one caught sight, upon a bell tower, of an enormous head and a bundle of disordered limbs swinging furiously at the end of a rope; it was Quasimodo ringing vespers or the Angelus.Often at night a hideous form was seen wandering along the frail balustrade of carved lacework, which crowns the towers and borders the circumference of the apse; again it was the hunchback of Notre-Dame.Then, said the women of the neighborhood, the whole church took on something fantastic, supernatural, horrible; eyes and mouths were opened, here and there; one heard the dogs, the monsters, and the gargoyles of stone, which keep watch night and day, with outstretched neck and open jaws, around the monstrous cathedral, barking.And, if it was a Christmas Eve, while the great bell, which seemed to emit the death rattle, summoned the faithful to the midnight mass, such an air was spread over the sombre facade that one would have declared that the grand",

    "history": "Hence it follows that both of us remain very virtuous.\"\"So,\" resumed Claude, whose brow cleared more and more, \"you believe, Master Pierre, that this creature has not been approached by any man?\"\"What would you have a man do, Dom Claude, as against a superstition?She has got that in her head.I assuredly esteem as a rarity this nunlike prudery which is preserved untamed amid those Bohemian girls who are so easily brought into subjection.But she has three things to protect her: the Duke of Egypt, who has taken her under his safeguard, reckoning, perchance, on selling her to some gay abbe; all his tribe, who hold her in singular veneration, like a Notre-Dame; and a certain tiny poignard, which the buxom dame always wears about her, in some nook, in spite of the ordinances of the provost, and which one causes to fly out into her hands by squeezing her waist. 'Tis a proud wasp, I can tell you!\"The archdeacon pressed Gringoire with questions.La Esmeralda, in the judgment of Gringoire, was an inoffensive and charming creature, pretty, with the exception of a pout which was peculiar to her; a naive and passionate damsel, ignorant of everything and enthusiastic about everything; not yet aware of the difference between a man and a woman, even in her dreams; made like that; wild especially over dancing, noise, the open air; a sort of woman bee, with invisible wings on her feet, and living in a whirlwind.She owed this nature to the wandering life which she had always led.Gringoire had succeeded in learning that, while a mere child, she had traversed Spain and Catalonia, even to Sicily; he believed that she had even been taken by the caravan of Zingari, of which she formed a part, to the kingdom of Algiers, a country situated in Achaia, which country adjoins, on one side Albania and Greece; on the other, the Sicilian Sea, which is the road to Constantinople.The Bohemians, said Gringoire, were vassals of the King of Algiers, in his quality of chief of the White Moors.One thing is certain, that la Esmeralda had come to France while still very young, by way of Hungary.From all these countries the young girl had brought back fragments of queer jargons, songs, and strange ideas, which made her language as motley as her costume, half Parisian, half African.However, the people of the quarters which she frequented loved her for her gayety, her daintiness, her lively manners, her dances, and her songs.She believed herself to be hated, in all the city, by but two persons, of whom she often spoke in terror: the sacked nun of the Tour-Roland, a villanous recluse who cherished some secret grudge against these gypsies, and who cursed the poor dancer every time that the latter passed before her window; and a priest, who never met her without casting at her looks and words which frightened her.The mention of this last circumstance disturbed the archdeacon greatly, though Gringoire paid no attention to his perturbation; to such an extent had two months sufficed to cause the heedless poet to forget the singular details of the evening on which he had met the gypsy, and the presence of the archdeacon in it all.Otherwise, the little dancer feared nothing; she did not tell fortunes, which protected her against those trials for magic which were so frequently instituted against gypsy women.And then, Gringoire held the position of her brother, if not of her husband.After all, the philosopher endured this sort of platonic marriage very patiently.It meant a shelter and bread at least.Every morning, he set out from the lair of the thieves, generally with the gypsy; he helped her make her collections of targes* and little blanks** in the squares; each evening he returned to the same roof with her, allowed her to bolt herself into her little chamber, and slept the sleep of the just.A very sweet existence, taking it all in all, he said, and well adapted to revery.And then, on his soul and conscience, the philosopher was not very sure that he was madly in love with the gypsy.He loved her goat almost as dearly.It was a charming animal, gentle, intelligent, clever; a learned goat.Nothing was more common in the Middle Ages than these learned animals, which amazed people greatly, and often led their instructors to the stake.But the witchcraft of the goat with the golden hoofs was a very innocent species of magic.Gringoire explained them to the archdeacon, whom these details seemed to interest deeply.In the majority of cases, it was sufficient to present the tambourine to the goat in such or such a manner, in order to obtain from him the trick desired.He had been trained to this by the gypsy, who possessed, in these delicate arts, so rare a talent that two months had sufficed to teach the goat to write, with movable letters, the word \"Phoebus.\"*  An ancient Burgundian coin.** An ancient French coin.",

    "history": "Aymoire relates that a stag, being chased by Dagobert, having taken refuge near the tomb of Saint-Denis, the pack of hounds stopped short and barked.Churches generally had a small apartment prepared for the reception of supplicants.In 1407, Nicolas Flamel caused to be built on the vaults of Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie, a chamber which cost him four livres six sous, sixteen farthings, parisis.At Notre-Dame it was a tiny cell situated on the roof of the side aisle, beneath the flying buttresses, precisely at the spot where the wife of the present janitor of the towers has made for herself a garden, which is to the hanging gardens of Babylon what a lettuce is to a palm-tree, what a porter's wife is to a Semiramis.It was here that Quasimodo had deposited la Esmeralda, after his wild and triumphant course.As long as that course lasted, the young girl had been unable to recover her senses, half unconscious, half awake, no longer feeling anything, except that she was mounting through the air, floating in it, flying in it, that something was raising her above the earth.From time to time she heard the loud laughter, the noisy voice of Quasimodo in her ear; she half opened her eyes; then below her she confusedly beheld Paris checkered with its thousand roofs of slate and tiles, like a red and blue mosaic, above her head the frightful and joyous face of Quasimodo.Then her eyelids drooped again; she thought that all was over, that they had executed her during her swoon, and that the misshapen spirit which had presided over her destiny, had laid hold of her and was bearing her away.She dared not look at him, and she surrendered herself to her fate.But when the bellringer, dishevelled and panting, had deposited her in the cell of refuge, when she felt his huge hands gently detaching the cord which bruised her arms, she felt that sort of shock which awakens with a start the passengers of a vessel which runs aground in the middle of a dark night.Her thoughts awoke also, and returned to her one by one.She saw that she was in Notre-Dame; she remembered having been torn from the hands of the executioner; that Phoebus was alive, that Phoebus loved her no longer; and as these two ideas, one of which shed so much bitterness over the other, presented themselves simultaneously to the poor condemned girl; she turned to Quasimodo, who was standing in front of her, and who terrified her; she said to him,--\"Why have you saved me?\"He gazed at her with anxiety, as though seeking to divine what she was saying to him.She repeated her question.Then he gave her a profoundly sorrowful glance and fled.She was astonished.A few moments later he returned, bearing a package which he cast at her feet.It was clothing which some charitable women had left on the threshold of the church for her.Then she dropped her eyes upon herself and saw that she was almost naked, and blushed.Life had returned.Quasimodo appeared to experience something of this modesty.He covered his eyes with his large hand and retired once more, but slowly.She made haste to dress herself.The robe was a white one with a white veil,--the garb of a novice of the Hotel-Dien.She had barely finished when she beheld Quasimodo returning.He carried a basket under one arm and a mattress under the other.In the basket there was a bottle, bread, and some provisions.He set the basket on the floor and said, \"Eat!\"He spread the mattress on the flagging and said, \"Sleep.\"It was his own repast, it was his own bed, which the bellringer had gone in search of.The gypsy raised her eyes to thank him, but she could not articulate a word.She dropped her head with a quiver of terror.Then he said to her.--  \"I frighten you.I am very ugly, am I not?Do not look at me; only listen to me.During the day you will remain here; at night you can walk all over the church.But do not leave the church either by day or by night.You would be lost.They would kill you, and I should die.\"She was touched and raised her head to answer him.He had disappeared.She found herself alone once more, meditating upon the singular words of this almost monstrous being, and struck by the sound of his voice, which was so hoarse yet so gentle.Then she examined her cell.It was a chamber about six feet square, with a small window and a door on the slightly sloping plane of the roof formed of flat stones.Many gutters with the figures of animals seemed to be bending down around her, and stretching their necks in order to stare at her through the window.Over the edge of her roof she perceived the tops of thousands of chimneys which caused the smoke of all the fires in Paris to rise beneath her eyes.A sad sight for the poor gypsy, a foundling, condemned to death, an unhappy creature, without country, without family, without a hearthstone.",

    "history": "Claude Frollo had been destined from infancy, by his parents, to the ecclesiastical profession.He had been taught to read in Latin; he had been trained to keep his eyes on the ground and to speak low.While still a child, his father had cloistered him in the college of Torchi in the University.There it was that he had grown up, on the missal and the lexicon.Moreover, he was a sad, grave, serious child, who studied ardently, and learned quickly; he never uttered a loud cry in recreation hour, mixed but little in the bacchanals of the Rue du Fouarre, did not know what it was to _dare alapas et capillos laniare_, and had cut no figure in that revolt of 1463, which the annalists register gravely, under the title of \"The sixth trouble of the University.\"He seldom rallied the poor students of Montaigu on the _cappettes_ from which they derived their name, or the bursars of the college of Dormans on their shaved tonsure, and their surtout parti- of bluish-green, blue, and violet cloth, _azurini coloris et bruni_, as says the charter of the Cardinal des Quatre-Couronnes.On the other hand, he was assiduous at the great and the small schools of the Rue Saint Jean de Beauvais.The first pupil whom the Abbe de Saint Pierre de Val, at the moment of beginning his reading on canon law, always perceived, glued to a pillar of the school Saint-Vendregesile, opposite his rostrum, was Claude Frollo, armed with his horn ink-bottle, biting his pen, scribbling on his threadbare knee, and, in winter, blowing on his fingers.The first auditor whom Messire Miles d'Isliers, doctor in decretals, saw arrive every Monday morning, all breathless, at the opening of the gates of the school of the Chef-Saint-Denis, was Claude Frollo.Thus, at sixteen years of age, the young clerk might have held his own, in mystical theology, against a father of the church; in canonical theology, against a father of the councils; in scholastic theology, against a doctor of Sorbonne.Theology conquered, he had plunged into decretals.From the \"Master of Sentences,\" he had passed to the \"Capitularies of Charlemagne;\" and he had devoured in succession, in his appetite for science, decretals upon decretals, those of Theodore, Bishop of Hispalus; those of Bouchard, Bishop of Worms; those of Yves, Bishop of Chartres; next the decretal of Gratian, which succeeded the capitularies of Charlemagne; then the collection of Gregory IX.;then the Epistle of _Superspecula_, of Honorius III.He rendered clear and familiar to himself that vast and tumultuous period of civil law and canon law in conflict and at strife with each other, in the chaos of the Middle Ages,--a period which Bishop Theodore opens in 618, and which Pope Gregory closes in 1227.Decretals digested, he flung himself upon medicine, on the liberal arts.He studied the science of herbs, the science of unguents; he became an expert in fevers and in contusions, in sprains and abcesses.Jacques d' Espars would have received him as a physician; Richard Hellain, as a surgeon.He also passed through all the degrees of licentiate, master, and doctor of arts.He studied the languages, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, a triple sanctuary then very little frequented.His was a veritable fever for acquiring and hoarding, in the matter of science.At the age of eighteen, he had made his way through the four faculties; it seemed to the young man that life had but one sole object: learning.It was towards this epoch, that the excessive heat of the summer of 1466 caused that grand outburst of the plague which carried off more than forty thousand souls in the vicomty of Paris, and among others, as Jean de Troyes states, \"Master Arnoul, astrologer to the king, who was a very fine man, both wise and pleasant.\"The rumor spread in the University that the Rue Tirechappe was especially devastated by the malady.It was there that Claude's parents resided, in the midst of their fief.The young scholar rushed in great alarm to the paternal mansion.When he entered it, he found that both father and mother had died on the preceding day.A very young brother of his, who was in swaddling clothes, was still alive and crying abandoned in his cradle.This was all that remained to Claude of his family; the young man took the child under his arm and went off in a pensive mood.Up to that moment, he had lived only in science; he now began to live in life.This catastrophe was a crisis in Claude's existence.",

Despreaux, \"not very voluptuous.\"He did not belong to that chevalier and musketeer species, who take young girls by assault.In the matter of love, as in all other affairs, he willingly assented to temporizing and adjusting terms; and a good supper, and an amiable tete-a-tete appeared to him, especially when he was hungry, an excellent interlude between the prologue and the catastrophe of a love adventure.The gypsy did not reply.She made her disdainful little grimace, drew up her head like a bird, then burst out laughing, and the tiny poniard disappeared as it had come, without Gringoire being able to see where the wasp concealed its sting.A moment later, there stood upon the table a loaf of rye bread, a slice of bacon, some wrinkled apples and a jug of beer.Gringoire began to eat eagerly.One would have said, to hear the furious clashing of his iron fork and his earthenware plate, that all his love had turned to appetite.The young girl seated opposite him, watched him in silence, visibly preoccupied with another thought, at which she smiled from time to time, while her soft hand caressed the intelligent head of the goat, gently pressed between her knees.A candle of yellow wax illuminated this scene of voracity and revery.Meanwhile, the first cravings of his stomach having been stilled, Gringoire felt some false shame at perceiving that nothing remained but one apple.\"You do not eat, Mademoiselle Esmeralda?\"She replied by a negative sign of the head, and her pensive glance fixed itself upon the vault of the ceiling.\"What the deuce is she thinking of?\"thought Gringoire, staring at what she was gazing at; \"'tis impossible that it can be that stone dwarf carved in the keystone of that arch, which thus absorbs her attention.What the deuce!I can bear the comparison!\"He raised his voice, \"Mademoiselle!\"She seemed not to hear him.He repeated, still more loudly, \"Mademoiselle Esmeralda!\"Trouble wasted.The young girl's mind was elsewhere, and Gringoire's voice had not the power to recall it.Fortunately, the goat interfered",

    "snippet_former_context": "Nevertheless, there was one human creature whom Quasimodo excepted from his malice and from his hatred for others, and whom he loved even more, perhaps, than his cathedral: this was Claude Frollo.The matter was simple; Claude Frollo had taken him in, had adopted him, had nourished him, had reared him.When a little lad, it was between Claude Frollo's legs that he was accustomed to seek refuge, when the dogs and the children barked after him.Claude Frollo had taught him to talk, to read, to write.Claude Frollo had finally made him the bellringer.Now, to give the big bell in marriage to Quasimodo was to give Juliet to Romeo.",

    "history": "At length the grand peal began; the whole tower trembled; woodwork, leads, cut stones, all groaned at once, from the piles of the foundation to the trefoils of its summit.Then Quasimodo boiled and frothed; he went and came; he trembled from head to foot with the tower.The bell, furious, running riot, presented to the two walls of the tower alternately its brazen throat, whence escaped that tempestuous breath, which is audible leagues away.Quasimodo stationed himself in front of this open throat; he crouched and rose with the oscillations of the bell, breathed in this overwhelming breath, gazed by turns at the deep place, which swarmed with people, two hundred feet below him, and at that enormous, brazen tongue which came, second after second, to howl in his ear.It was the only speech which he understood, the only sound which broke for him the universal silence.He swelled out in it as a bird does in the sun.All of a sudden, the frenzy of the bell seized upon him; his look became extraordinary; he lay in wait for the great bell as it passed, as a spider lies in wait for a fly, and flung himself abruptly upon it, with might and main.Then, suspended above the abyss, borne to and fro by the formidable swinging of the bell, he seized the brazen monster by the ear-laps, pressed it between both knees, spurred it on with his heels, and redoubled the fury of the peal with the whole shock and weight of his body.Meanwhile, the tower trembled; he shrieked and gnashed his teeth, his red hair rose erect, his breast heaving like a bellows, his eye flashed flames, the monstrous bell neighed, panting, beneath him; and then it was no longer the great bell of Notre-Dame nor Quasimodo: it was a dream, a whirlwind, a tempest, dizziness mounted astride of noise; a spirit clinging to a flying crupper, a strange centaur, half man, half bell; a sort of horrible Astolphus, borne away upon a prodigious hippogriff of living bronze.The presence of this extraordinary being caused, as it were, a breath of life to circulate throughout the entire cathedral.It seemed as though there escaped from him, at least according to the growing superstitions of the crowd, a mysterious emanation which animated all the stones of Notre-Dame, and made the deep bowels of the ancient church to palpitate.It sufficed for people to know that he was there, to make them believe that they beheld the thousand statues of the galleries and the fronts in motion.And the cathedral did indeed seem a docile and obedient creature beneath his hand; it waited on his will to raise its great voice; it was possessed and filled with Quasimodo, as with a familiar spirit.One would have said that he made the immense edifice breathe.He was everywhere about it; in fact, he multiplied himself on all points of the structure.Now one perceived with affright at the very top of one of the towers, a fantastic dwarf climbing, writhing, crawling on all fours, descending outside above the abyss, leaping from projection to projection, and going to ransack the belly of some sculptured gorgon; it was Quasimodo dislodging the crows.Again, in some obscure corner of the church one came in contact with a sort of living chimera, crouching and scowling; it was Quasimodo engaged in thought.Sometimes one caught sight, upon a bell tower, of an enormous head and a bundle of disordered limbs swinging furiously at the end of a rope; it was Quasimodo ringing vespers or the Angelus.Often at night a hideous form was seen wandering along the frail balustrade of carved lacework, which crowns the towers and borders the circumference of the apse; again it was the hunchback of Notre-Dame.Then, said the women of the neighborhood, the whole church took on something fantastic, supernatural, horrible; eyes and mouths were opened, here and there; one heard the dogs, the monsters, and the gargoyles of stone, which keep watch night and day, with outstretched neck and open jaws, around the monstrous cathedral, barking.And, if it was a Christmas Eve, while the great bell, which seemed to emit the death rattle, summoned the faithful to the midnight mass, such an air was spread over the sombre facade that one would have declared that the grand portal was devouring the throng, and that the rose window was watching it.And all this came from Quasimodo.Egypt would have taken him for the god of this temple; the Middle Ages believed him to be its demon: he was in fact its soul.To such an extent was this disease that for those who know that Quasimodo has existed, Notre-Dame is to-day deserted, inanimate, dead.One feels that something has disappeared from it.That immense body is empty; it is a skeleton; the spirit has quitted it, one sees its place and that is all.It is like a skull which still has holes for the eyes, but no longer sight.CHAPTER IV.THE DOG AND HIS MASTER.",

    "history": "As soon as Pierre Gringoire had seen how this whole affair was turning, and that there would decidedly be the rope, hanging, and other disagreeable things for the principal personages in this comedy, he had not cared to identify himself with the matter further.The outcasts with whom he had remained, reflecting that, after all, it was the best company in Paris,--the outcasts had continued to interest themselves in behalf of the gypsy.He had thought it very simple on the part of people who had, like herself, nothing else in prospect but Charmolue and Torterue, and who, unlike himself, did not gallop through the regions of imagination between the wings of Pegasus.From their remarks, he had learned that his wife of the broken crock had taken refuge in Notre-Dame, and he was very glad of it.But he felt no temptation to go and see her there.He meditated occasionally on the little goat, and that was all.Moreover, he was busy executing feats of strength during the day for his living, and at night he was engaged in composing a memorial against the Bishop of Paris, for he remembered having been drenched by the wheels of his mills, and he cherished a grudge against him for it.He also occupied himself with annotating the fine work of Baudry-le-Rouge, Bishop of Noyon and Tournay, _De Cupa Petrarum_, which had given him a violent passion for architecture, an inclination which had replaced in his heart his passion for hermeticism, of which it was, moreover, only a natural corollary, since there is an intimate relation between hermeticism and masonry.Gringoire had passed from the love of an idea to the love of the form of that idea.One day he had halted near Saint Germain-l'Auxerrois, at the corner of a mansion called \"For-l'Eveque\" (the Bishop's Tribunal), which stood opposite another called \"For-le-Roi\" (the King's Tribunal).At this For-l'Eveque, there was a charming chapel of the fourteenth century, whose apse was on the street.Gringoire was devoutly examining its exterior sculptures.He was in one of those moments of egotistical, exclusive, supreme, enjoyment when the artist beholds nothing in the world but art, and the world in art.All at once he feels a hand laid gravely on his shoulder.He turns round.It was his old friend, his former master, monsieur the archdeacon.He was stupefied.It was a long time since he had seen the archdeacon, and Dom Claude was one of those solemn and impassioned men, a meeting with whom always upsets the equilibrium of a sceptical philosopher.The archdeacon maintained silence for several minutes, during which Gringoire had time to observe him.He found Dom Claude greatly changed; pale as a winter's morning, with hollow eyes, and hair almost white.The priest broke the silence at length, by saying, in a tranquil but glacial tone,--  \"How do you do, Master Pierre?\"\"My health?\"replied Gringoire. \"Eh!eh!one can say both one thing and another on that score.Still, it is good, on the whole.I take not too much of anything.You know, master, that the secret of keeping well, according to Hippocrates; _id est: cibi, potus, somni, venus, omnia moderata sint_.\"\"So you have no care, Master Pierre?\"resumed the archdeacon, gazing intently at Gringoire.\"None, i' faith!\"\"And what are you doing now?\"\"You see, master.I am examining the chiselling of these stones, and the manner in which yonder bas-relief is thrown out.\"The priest began to smile with that bitter smile which raises only one corner of the mouth.\"And that amuses you?\"\"'Tis paradise!\"exclaimed Gringoire.And leaning over the sculptures with the fascinated air of a demonstrator of living phenomena: \"Do you not think, for instance, that yon metamorphosis in bas-relief is executed with much adroitness, delicacy and patience?Observe that slender column.Around what capital have you seen foliage more tender and better caressed by the chisel.Here are three raised bosses of Jean Maillevin.They are not the finest works of this great master.Nevertheless, the naivete, the sweetness of the faces, the gayety of the attitudes and draperies, and that inexplicable charm which is mingled with all the defects, render the little figures very diverting and delicate, perchance, even too much so.You think that it is not diverting?\"\"Yes, certainly!\"said the priest.\"And if you were to see the interior of the chapel!\"resumed the poet, with his garrulous enthusiasm. \"Carvings everywhere.

    "history": "And the inexplicable point about it is that the more blind is this passion, the more tenacious it is.It is never more solid than when it has no reason in it.La Esmeralda did not think of the captain without bitterness, no doubt.No doubt it was terrible that he also should have been deceived; that he should have believed that impossible thing, that he could have conceived of a stab dealt by her who would have given a thousand lives for him.But, after all, she must not be too angry with him for it; had she not confessed her crime?had she not yielded, weak woman that she was, to torture?The fault was entirely hers.She should have allowed her finger nails to be torn out rather than such a word to be wrenched from her.In short, if she could but see Phoebus once more, for a single minute, only one word would be required, one look, in order to undeceive him, to bring him back.She did not doubt it.She was astonished also at many singular things, at the accident of Phoebus's presence on the day of the penance, at the young girl with whom he had been.She was his sister, no doubt.An unreasonable explanation, but she contented herself with it, because she needed to believe that Phoebus still loved her, and loved her alone.Had he not sworn it to her?What more was needed, simple and credulous as she was?And then, in this matter, were not appearances much more against her than against him?Accordingly, she waited.She hoped.Let us add that the church, that vast church, which surrounded her on every side, which guarded her, which saved her, was itself a sovereign tranquillizer.The solemn lines of that architecture, the religious attitude of all the objects which surrounded the young girl, the serene and pious thoughts which emanated, so to speak, from all the pores of that stone, acted upon her without her being aware of it.The edifice had also sounds fraught with such benediction and such majesty, that they soothed this ailing soul.The monotonous chanting of the celebrants, the responses of the people to the priest, sometimes inarticulate, sometimes thunderous, the harmonious trembling of the painted windows, the organ, bursting forth like a hundred trumpets, the three belfries, humming like hives of huge bees, that whole orchestra on which bounded a gigantic scale, ascending, descending incessantly from the voice of a throng to that of one bell, dulled her memory, her imagination, her grief.The bells, in particular, lulled her.It was something like a powerful magnetism which those vast instruments shed over her in great waves.Thus every sunrise found her more calm, breathing better, less pale.In proportion as her inward wounds closed, her grace and beauty blossomed once more on her countenance, but more thoughtful, more reposeful.Her former character also returned to her, somewhat even of her gayety, her pretty pout, her love for her goat, her love for singing, her modesty.She took care to dress herself in the morning in the corner of her cell for fear some inhabitants of the neighboring attics might see her through the window.When the thought of Phoebus left her time, the gypsy sometimes thought of Quasimodo.He was the sole bond, the sole connection, the sole communication which remained to her with men, with the living.Unfortunate girl!she was more outside the world than Quasimodo.She understood not in the least the strange friend whom chance had given her.She often reproached herself for not feeling a gratitude which should close her eyes, but decidedly, she could not accustom herself to the poor bellringer.He was too ugly.She had left the whistle which he had given her lying on the ground.This did not prevent Quasimodo from making his appearance from time to time during the first few days.She did her best not to turn aside with too much repugnance when he came to bring her her basket of provisions or her jug of water, but he always perceived the slightest movement of this sort, and then he withdrew sadly.Once he came at the moment when she was caressing Djali.He stood pensively for several minutes before this graceful group of the goat and the gypsy; at last he said, shaking his heavy and ill-formed head,--  \"My misfortune is that I still resemble a man too much.I should like to be wholly a beast like that goat.\"She gazed at him in amazement.He replied to the glance,--  \"Oh!I well know why,\" and he went away.On another occasion he presented himself at the door of the cell (which he never entered) at the moment when la Esmeralda was singing an old Spanish ballad, the words of which she did not understand, but which had lingered in her ear because the gypsy women had lulled her to sleep with it when she was a little child.At the sight of that villanous form which made its appearance so abruptly in the middle of her song, the young girl paused with an involuntary gesture of alarm.The unhappy bellringer fell upon his knees on the threshold, and clasped his large, misshapen hands with a suppliant air.",

    "history": "\"The Sainte-Marthe chamber,\" said he.The old woman addressed him as monseigneur, and shut up the crown in a drawer.It was the coin which the man in the black mantle had given to Phoebus.While her back was turned, the bushy-headed and ragged little boy who was playing in the ashes, adroitly approached the drawer, abstracted the crown, and put in its place a dry leaf which he had plucked from a fagot.The old crone made a sign to the two gentlemen, as she called them, to follow her, and mounted the ladder in advance of them.On arriving at the upper story, she set her lamp on a coffer, and, Phoebus, like a frequent visitor of the house, opened a door which opened on a dark hole. \"Enter here, my dear fellow,\" he said to his companion.The man in the mantle obeyed without a word in reply, the door closed upon him; he heard Phoebus bolt it, and a moment later descend the stairs again with the aged hag.The light had disappeared.CHAPTER VIII.THE UTILITY OF WINDOWS WHICH OPEN ON THE RIVER.Claude Frollo (for we presume that the reader, more intelligent than Phoebus, has seen in this whole adventure no other surly monk than the archdeacon), Claude Frollo groped about for several moments in the dark lair into which the captain had bolted him.It was one of those nooks which architects sometimes reserve at the point of junction between the roof and the supporting wall.A vertical section of this kennel, as Phoebus had so justly styled it, would have made a triangle.Moreover, there was neither window nor air-hole, and the <DW72> of the roof prevented one from standing upright.Accordingly, Claude crouched down in the dust, and the plaster which cracked beneath him; his head was on fire; rummaging around him with his hands, he found on the floor a bit of broken glass, which he pressed to his brow, and whose cool-ness afforded him some relief.What was taking place at that moment in the gloomy soul of the archdeacon?God and himself could alone know.In what order was he arranging in his mind la Esmeralda, Phoebus, Jacques Charmolue, his young brother so beloved, yet abandoned by him in the mire, his archdeacon's cassock, his reputation perhaps dragged to la Falourdel's, all these adventures, all these images?I cannot say.But it is certain that these ideas formed in his mind a horrible group.He had been waiting a quarter of an hour; it seemed to him that he had grown a century older.All at once he heard the creaking of the boards of the stairway; some one was ascending.The trapdoor opened once more; a light reappeared.There was a tolerably large crack in the worm-eaten door of his den; he put his face to it.In this manner he could see all that went on in the adjoining room.The cat-faced old crone was the first to emerge from the trap-door, lamp in hand; then Phoebus, twirling his moustache, then a third person, that beautiful and graceful figure, la Esmeralda.The priest beheld her rise from below like a dazzling apparition.Claude trembled, a cloud spread over his eyes, his pulses beat violently, everything rustled and whirled around him; he no longer saw nor heard anything.When he recovered himself, Phoebus and Esmeralda were alone seated on the wooden coffer beside the lamp which made these two youthful figures and a miserable pallet at the end of the attic stand out plainly before the archdeacon's eyes.Beside the pallet was a window, whose panes broken like a spider's web upon which rain has fallen, allowed a view, through its rent meshes, of a corner of the sky, and the moon lying far away on an eiderdown bed of soft clouds.The young girl was blushing, confused, palpitating.Her long, drooping lashes shaded her crimson cheeks.The officer, to whom she dared not lift her eyes, was radiant.Mechanically, and with a charmingly unconscious gesture, she traced with the tip of her finger incoherent lines on the bench, and watched her finger.Her foot was not visible.The little goat was nestling upon it.The captain was very gallantly clad; he had tufts of embroidery at his neck and wrists; a great elegance at that day.It was not without difficulty that Dom Claude managed to hear what they were saying, through the humming of the blood, which was boiling in his temples.(A conversation between lovers is a very commonplace affair.It is a perpetual \"I love you.\"A musical phrase which is very insipid and very bald for indifferent listeners, when it is not ornamented with some _fioriture_; but Claude was not an indifferent listener.)\"Oh!\"said the young girl, without raising her eyes, \"do not despise me, monseigneur Phoebus.I feel that what I am doing is not right.\"\"Despise you, my pretty child!\"",

THE CROWN CHANGED INTO A DRY LEAF.Gringoire and the entire Court of Miracles were suffering mortal anxiety.For a whole month they had not known what had become of la Esmeralda, which greatly pained the Duke of Egypt and his friends the vagabonds, nor what had become of the goat, which redoubled Gringoire's grief.One evening the gypsy had disappeared, and since that time had given no signs of life.All search had proved fruitless.Some tormenting bootblacks had told Gringoire about meeting her that same evening near the Pont Saint-Michel, going off with an officer; but this husband, after the fashion of Bohemia, was an incredulous philosopher, and besides, he, better than any one else, knew to what a point his wife was virginal.He had been able to form a judgment as to the unconquerable modesty resulting from the combined virtues of the amulet and the gypsy, and he had mathematically calculated the resistance of that chastity to the second power.Accordingly, he was at ease on that score.Still he could not understand this disappearance.It was a profound sorrow.He would have grown thin over it, had that been possible.He had forgotten everything, even his literary tastes, even his great work, _De figuris regularibus et irregularibus_, which it was his intention to have printed with the first money which he should procure (for he had raved over printing, ever since he had seen the \"Didascalon\" of Hugues de Saint Victor, printed with the celebrated characters of Vindelin de Spire).One day, as he was passing sadly before the criminal Tournelle, he perceived a considerable crowd at one of the gates of the Palais de Justice.\"What is this?\"he inquired of a young man who was coming out.\"I know not, sir,\" replied the young man. \"'Tis said that they are trying a woman who hath assassinated a gendarme.It appears that there is sorcery at the bottom of it, the archbishop and the official have intervened in the case, and my brother, who is the archdeacon of Josas, can think of nothing else.Now, I wished to speak with him, but I have not been able to reach him because of the throng, which vexes me greatly, as I stand in need of money.\"\"Alas!sir,\" said Gringoire, \"I would that I could lend you some, but, my breeches are worn to holes, and 'tis not crowns which have done it.\"He dared not tell the young man that he was acquainted with his brother the archdeacon, to whom he had not returned after the scene in the church; a negligence which embarrassed him.The scholar went his way, and Gringoire set out to follow the crowd which was mounting the staircase of the great chamber.In his opinion, there was nothing like the spectacle of a criminal process for dissipating melancholy, so exhilaratingly stupid are judges as a rule.The populace which he had joined walked and elbowed in silence.After a slow and tiresome march through a long, gloomy corridor, which wound through the court-house like the intestinal canal of the ancient edifice, he arrived near a low door, opening upon a hall which his lofty stature permitted him to survey with a glance over the waving heads of the rabble.The hall was vast and gloomy, which latter fact made it appear still more spacious.The day was declining; the long, pointed windows permitted only a pale ray of light to enter, which was extinguished before it reached the vaulted ceiling, an enormous trellis-work of sculptured beams, whose thousand figures seemed to move confusedly in the shadows, many candles were already lighted here and there on tables, and beaming on the heads of clerks buried in masses of documents.",

    "history": "Of the double noise which constitutes a church, the organ within, the bell without, the organ alone remained.One would have said that there was no longer a musician in the belfry.Quasimodo was always there, nevertheless; what, then, had happened to him?Was it that the shame and despair of the pillory still lingered in the bottom of his heart, that the lashes of his tormentor's whip reverberated unendingly in his soul, and that the sadness of such treatment had wholly extinguished in him even his passion for the bells?or was it that Marie had a rival in the heart of the bellringer of Notre-Dame, and that the great bell and her fourteen sisters were neglected for something more amiable and more beautiful?It chanced that, in the year of grace 1482, Annunciation Day fell on Tuesday, the twenty-fifth of March.That day the air was so pure and light that Quasimodo felt some returning affection for his bells.He therefore ascended the northern tower while the beadle below was opening wide the doors of the church, which were then enormous panels of stout wood, covered with leather, bordered with nails of gilded iron, and framed in carvings \"very artistically elaborated.\"On arriving in the lofty bell chamber, Quasimodo gazed for some time at the six bells and shook his head sadly, as though groaning over some foreign element which had interposed itself in his heart between them and him.But when he had set them to swinging, when he felt that cluster of bells moving under his hand, when he saw, for he did not hear it, the palpitating octave ascend and descend that sonorous scale, like a bird hopping from branch to branch; when the demon Music, that demon who shakes a sparkling bundle of strette, trills and arpeggios, had taken possession of the poor deaf man, he became happy once more, he forgot everything, and his heart expanding, made his face beam.He went and came, he beat his hands together, he ran from rope to rope, he animated the six singers with voice and gesture, like the leader of an orchestra who is urging on intelligent musicians.\"Go on,\" said he, \"go on, go on, Gabrielle, pour out all thy noise into the Place, 'tis a festival to-day.No laziness, Thibauld; thou art relaxing; go on, go on, then, art thou rusted, thou sluggard?That is well!quick!quick!let not thy clapper be seen!Make them all deaf like me.That's it, Thibauld, bravely done!Guillaume!Guillaume!thou art the largest, and Pasquier is the smallest, and Pasquier does best.Let us wager that those who hear him will understand him better than they understand thee.Good!good!my Gabrielle, stoutly, more stoutly!Eli!what are you doing up aloft there, you two Moineaux (sparrows)?I do not see you making the least little shred of noise.What is the meaning of those beaks of copper which seem to be gaping when they should sing?Come, work now, 'tis the Feast of the Annunciation.The sun is fine, the chime must be fine also.Poor Guillaume!thou art all out of breath, my big fellow!\"He was wholly absorbed in spurring on his bells, all six of which vied with each other in leaping and shaking their shining haunches, like a noisy team of Spanish mules, pricked on here and there by the apostrophes of the muleteer.All at once, on letting his glance fall between the large slate scales which cover the perpendicular wall of the bell tower at a certain height, he beheld on the square a young girl, fantastically dressed, stop, spread out on the ground a carpet, on which a small goat took up its post, and a group of spectators collect around her.This sight suddenly changed the course of his ideas, and congealed his enthusiasm as a breath of air congeals melted rosin.He halted, turned his back to the bells, and crouched down behind the projecting roof of slate, fixing upon the dancer that dreamy, sweet, and tender look which had already astonished the archdeacon on one occasion.Meanwhile, the forgotten bells died away abruptly and all together, to the great disappointment of the lovers of bell ringing, who were listening in good faith to the peal from above the Pont du Change, and who went away dumbfounded, like a dog who has been offered a bone and given a stone.CHAPTER IV. _ANANKE_.It chanced that upon a fine morning in this same month of March, I think it was on Saturday the 29th, Saint Eustache's day, our young friend the student, Jehan Frollo du Moulin, perceived, as he was dressing himself, that his breeches, which contained his purse, gave out no metallic ring.\"Poor purse,\" he said, drawing it from his fob, \"what!not the smallest parisis!how cruelly the dice, beer-pots, and Venus have depleted thee!How empty, wrinkled, limp, thou art!Thou resemblest the throat of a fury!",

    "history": "Claude Frollo had been destined from infancy, by his parents, to the ecclesiastical profession.He had been taught to read in Latin; he had been trained to keep his eyes on the ground and to speak low.While still a child, his father had cloistered him in the college of Torchi in the University.There it was that he had grown up, on the missal and the lexicon.Moreover, he was a sad, grave, serious child, who studied ardently, and learned quickly; he never uttered a loud cry in recreation hour, mixed but little in the bacchanals of the Rue du Fouarre, did not know what it was to _dare alapas et capillos laniare_, and had cut no figure in that revolt of 1463, which the annalists register gravely, under the title of \"The sixth trouble of the University.\"He seldom rallied the poor students of Montaigu on the _cappettes_ from which they derived their name, or the bursars of the college of Dormans on their shaved tonsure, and their surtout parti- of bluish-green, blue, and violet cloth, _azurini coloris et bruni_, as says the charter of the Cardinal des Quatre-Couronnes.On the other hand, he was assiduous at the great and the small schools of the Rue Saint Jean de Beauvais.The first pupil whom the Abbe de Saint Pierre de Val, at the moment of beginning his reading on canon law, always perceived, glued to a pillar of the school Saint-Vendregesile, opposite his rostrum, was Claude Frollo, armed with his horn ink-bottle, biting his pen, scribbling on his threadbare knee, and, in winter, blowing on his fingers.The first auditor whom Messire Miles d'Isliers, doctor in decretals, saw arrive every Monday morning, all breathless, at the opening of the gates of the school of the Chef-Saint-Denis, was Claude Frollo.Thus, at sixteen years of age, the young clerk might have held his own, in mystical theology, against a father of the church; in canonical theology, against a father of the councils; in scholastic theology, against a doctor of Sorbonne.Theology conquered, he had plunged into decretals.From the \"Master of Sentences,\" he had passed to the \"Capitularies of Charlemagne;\" and he had devoured in succession, in his appetite for science, decretals upon decretals, those of Theodore, Bishop of Hispalus; those of Bouchard, Bishop of Worms; those of Yves, Bishop of Chartres; next the decretal of Gratian, which succeeded the capitularies of Charlemagne; then the collection of Gregory IX.;then the Epistle of _Superspecula_, of Honorius III.He rendered clear and familiar to himself that vast and tumultuous period of civil law and canon law in conflict and at strife with each other, in the chaos of the Middle Ages,--a period which Bishop Theodore opens in 618, and which Pope Gregory closes in 1227.Decretals digested, he flung himself upon medicine, on the liberal arts.He studied the science of herbs, the science of unguents; he became an expert in fevers and in contusions, in sprains and abcesses.Jacques d' Espars would have received him as a physician; Richard Hellain, as a surgeon.He also passed through all the degrees of licentiate, master, and doctor of arts.He studied the languages, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, a triple sanctuary then very little frequented.His was a veritable fever for acquiring and hoarding, in the matter of science.At the age of eighteen, he had made his way through the four faculties; it seemed to the young man that life had but one sole object: learning.It was towards this epoch, that the excessive heat of the summer of 1466 caused that grand outburst of the plague which carried off more than forty thousand souls in the vicomty of Paris, and among others, as Jean de Troyes states, \"Master Arnoul, astrologer to the king, who was a very fine man, both wise and pleasant.\"The rumor spread in the University that the Rue Tirechappe was especially devastated by the malady.It was there that Claude's parents resided, in the midst of their fief.The young scholar rushed in great alarm to the paternal mansion.When he entered it, he found that both father and mother had died on the preceding day.A very young brother of his, who was in swaddling clothes, was still alive and crying abandoned in his cradle.This was all that remained to Claude of his family; the young man took the child under his arm and went off in a pensive mood.Up to that moment, he had lived only in science; he now began to live in life.This catastrophe was a crisis in Claude's existence.",

    "history": "Tis a proud wasp, I can tell you!\"The archdeacon pressed Gringoire with questions.La Esmeralda, in the judgment of Gringoire, was an inoffensive and charming creature, pretty, with the exception of a pout which was peculiar to her; a naive and passionate damsel, ignorant of everything and enthusiastic about everything; not yet aware of the difference between a man and a woman, even in her dreams; made like that; wild especially over dancing, noise, the open air; a sort of woman bee, with invisible wings on her feet, and living in a whirlwind.She owed this nature to the wandering life which she had always led.Gringoire had succeeded in learning that, while a mere child, she had traversed Spain and Catalonia, even to Sicily; he believed that she had even been taken by the caravan of Zingari, of which she formed a part, to the kingdom of Algiers, a country situated in Achaia, which country adjoins, on one side Albania and Greece; on the other, the Sicilian Sea, which is the road to Constantinople.The Bohemians, said Gringoire, were vassals of the King of Algiers, in his quality of chief of the White Moors.One thing is certain, that la Esmeralda had come to France while still very young, by way of Hungary.From all these countries the young girl had brought back fragments of queer jargons, songs, and strange ideas, which made her language as motley as her costume, half Parisian, half African.However, the people of the quarters which she frequented loved her for her gayety, her daintiness, her lively manners, her dances, and her songs.She believed herself to be hated, in all the city, by but two persons, of whom she often spoke in terror: the sacked nun of the Tour-Roland, a villanous recluse who cherished some secret grudge against these gypsies, and who cursed the poor dancer every time that the latter passed before her window; and a priest, who never met her without casting at her looks and words which frightened her.The mention of this last circumstance disturbed the archdeacon greatly, though Gringoire paid no attention to his perturbation; to such an extent had two months sufficed to cause the heedless poet to forget the singular details of the evening on which he had met the gypsy, and the presence of the archdeacon in it all.Otherwise, the little dancer feared nothing; she did not tell fortunes, which protected her against those trials for magic which were so frequently instituted against gypsy women.And then, Gringoire held the position of her brother, if not of her husband.After all, the philosopher endured this sort of platonic marriage very patiently.It meant a shelter and bread at least.Every morning, he set out from the lair of the thieves, generally with the gypsy; he helped her make her collections of targes* and little blanks** in the squares; each evening he returned to the same roof with her, allowed her to bolt herself into her little chamber, and slept the sleep of the just.A very sweet existence, taking it all in all, he said, and well adapted to revery.And then, on his soul and conscience, the philosopher was not very sure that he was madly in love with the gypsy.He loved her goat almost as dearly.It was a charming animal, gentle, intelligent, clever; a learned goat.Nothing was more common in the Middle Ages than these learned animals, which amazed people greatly, and often led their instructors to the stake.But the witchcraft of the goat with the golden hoofs was a very innocent species of magic.Gringoire explained them to the archdeacon, whom these details seemed to interest deeply.In the majority of cases, it was sufficient to present the tambourine to the goat in such or such a manner, in order to obtain from him the trick desired.He had been trained to this by the gypsy, who possessed, in these delicate arts, so rare a talent that two months had sufficed to teach the goat to write, with movable letters, the word \"Phoebus.\"*  An ancient Burgundian coin.** An ancient French coin.\"'Phoebus!'\"said the priest; \"why 'Phoebus'?\"\"I know not,\" replied Gringoire. \"Perhaps it is a word which she believes to be endowed with some magic and secret virtue.She often repeats it in a low tone when she thinks that she is alone.\"\"Are you sure,\" persisted Claude, with his penetrating glance, \"that it is only a word and not a name?\"\"The name of whom?\"said the poet.\"How should I know?\"said the priest.\"This is what I imagine, messire.These Bohemians are something like Guebrs, and adore the sun.Hence, Phoebus.\"\"That does not seem so clear to me as to you, Master Pierre.\"\"After all, that does not concern me.Let her mumble her Phoebus at her pleasure.",

    "history": "Then there became visible in all its length, the deep, gloomy church, hung in black, sparely lighted with a few candles gleaming afar off on the principal altar, opened in the midst of the Place which was dazzling with light, like the mouth of a cavern.At the very extremity, in the gloom of the apse, a gigantic silver cross was visible against a black drapery which hung from the vault to the pavement.The whole nave was deserted.But a few heads of priests could be seen moving confusedly in the distant choir stalls, and, at the moment when the great door opened, there escaped from the church a loud, solemn, and monotonous chanting, which cast over the head of the condemned girl, in gusts, fragments of melancholy psalms,--  \"_Non timebo millia populi circumdantis me: exsurge, Domine; salvum me fac, Deus_!\"\"_Salvum me fac, Deus, quoniam intraverunt aquae usque ad animam meam_.\"_Infixus sum in limo profundi; et non est substantia_.\"At the same time, another voice, separate from the choir, intoned upon the steps of the chief altar, this melancholy offertory,--\"_Qui verbum meum audit, et credit ei qui misit me, habet vitam oeternam et in judicium non venit; sed transit a morte im vitam_*.\"* \"He that heareth my word and believeth on Him that sent me, hath eternal life, and hath not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.\"This chant, which a few old men buried in the gloom sang from afar over that beautiful creature, full of youth and life, caressed by the warm air of spring, inundated with sunlight was the mass for the dead.The people listened devoutly.The unhappy girl seemed to lose her sight and her consciousness in the obscure interior of the church.Her white lips moved as though in prayer, and the headsman's assistant who approached to assist her to alight from the cart, heard her repeating this word in a low tone,--\"Phoebus.\"They untied her hands, made her alight, accompanied by her goat, which had also been unbound, and which bleated with joy at finding itself free: and they made her walk barefoot on the hard pavement to the foot of the steps leading to the door.The rope about her neck trailed behind her.One would have said it was a serpent following her.Then the chanting in the church ceased.A great golden cross and a row of wax candles began to move through the gloom.The halberds of the motley beadles clanked; and, a few moments later, a long procession of priests in chasubles, and deacons in dalmatics, marched gravely towards the condemned girl, as they drawled their song, spread out before her view and that of the crowd.But her glance rested on the one who marched at the head, immediately after the cross-bearer.\"Oh!\"she said in a low voice, and with a shudder, \"'tis he again!the priest!\"It was in fact, the archdeacon.On his left he had the sub-chanter, on his right, the chanter, armed with his official wand.He advanced with head thrown back, his eyes fixed and wide open, intoning in a strong voice,--  \"_De ventre inferi clamavi, et exaudisti vocem meam_.\"_Et projecisti me in profundum in corde mans, et flumem circumdedit me_*.\"*  \"Out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice.For thou hadst cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas, and the floods compassed me about.\"At the moment when he made his appearance in the full daylight beneath the lofty arched portal, enveloped in an ample cope of silver barred with a black cross, he was so pale that more than one person in the crowd thought that one of the marble bishops who knelt on the sepulchral stones of the choir had risen and was come to receive upon the brink of the tomb, the woman who was about to die.She, no less pale, no less like a statue, had hardly noticed that they had placed in her hand a heavy, lighted candle of yellow wax; she had not heard the yelping voice of the clerk reading the fatal contents of the apology; when they told her to respond with Amen, she responded Amen.She only recovered life and force when she beheld the priest make a sign to her guards to withdraw, and himself advance alone towards her.Then she felt her blood boil in her head, and a remnant of indignation flashed up in that soul already benumbed and cold.The archdeacon approached her slowly; even in that extremity, she beheld him cast an eye sparkling with sensuality, jealousy, and desire, over her exposed form.Then he said aloud,--  \"Young girl, have you asked God's pardon for your faults and shortcomings?\"",

    "history": "There was hardly a spectator in that crowd who had not or who did not believe that he had reason to complain of the malevolent hunchback of Notre-Dame.The joy at seeing him appear thus in the pillory had been universal; and the harsh punishment which he had just suffered, and the pitiful condition in which it had left him, far from softening the populace had rendered its hatred more malicious by arming it with a touch of mirth.Hence, the \"public prosecution\" satisfied, as the bigwigs of the law still express it in their jargon, the turn came of a thousand private vengeances.Here, as in the Grand Hall, the women rendered themselves particularly prominent.All cherished some rancor against him, some for his malice, others for his ugliness.The latter were the most furious.\"Oh!mask of Antichrist!\"said one.\"Rider on a broom handle!\"cried another.\"What a fine tragic grimace,\" howled a third, \"and who would make him Pope of the Fools if to-day were yesterday?\"\"'Tis well,\" struck in an old woman. \"This is the grimace of the pillory.When shall we have that of the gibbet?\"\"When will you be coiffed with your big bell a hundred feet under ground, cursed bellringer?\"\"But 'tis the devil who rings the Angelus!\"\"Oh!the deaf man!the one-eyed creature!the hunch-back!the monster!\"\"A face to make a woman miscarry better than all the drugs and medicines!\"And the two scholars, Jehan du Moulin, and Robin Poussepain, sang at the top of their lungs, the ancient refrain,--      \"_Une hart    Pour le pendard!Un fagot    Pour le magot_!\"**  A rope for the gallows bird!A fagot for the ape.A thousand other insults rained down upon him, and hoots and imprecations, and laughter, and now and then, stones.Quasimodo was deaf but his sight was clear, and the public fury was no less energetically depicted on their visages than in their words.Moreover, the blows from the stones explained the bursts of laughter.At first he held his ground.But little by little that patience which had borne up under the lash of the torturer, yielded and gave way before all these stings of insects.The bull of the Asturias who has been but little moved by the attacks of the picador grows irritated with the dogs and banderilleras.He first cast around a slow glance of hatred upon the crowd.But bound as he was, his glance was powerless to drive away those flies which were stinging his wound.Then he moved in his bonds, and his furious exertions made the ancient wheel of the pillory shriek on its axle.All this only increased the derision and hooting.Then the wretched man, unable to break his collar, like that of a chained wild beast, became tranquil once more; only at intervals a sigh of rage heaved the hollows of his chest.There was neither shame nor redness on his face.He was too far from the state of society, and too near the state of nature to know what shame was.Moreover, with such a degree of deformity, is infamy a thing that can be felt?But wrath, hatred, despair, slowly lowered over that hideous visage a cloud which grew ever more and more sombre, ever more and more charged with electricity, which burst forth in a thousand lightning flashes from the eye of the cyclops.Nevertheless, that cloud cleared away for a moment, at the passage of a mule which traversed the crowd, bearing a priest.As far away as he could see that mule and that priest, the poor victim's visage grew gentler.The fury which had contracted it was followed by a strange smile full of ineffable sweetness, gentleness, and tenderness.In proportion as the priest approached, that smile became more clear, more distinct, more radiant.It was like the arrival of a Saviour, which the unhappy man was greeting.But as soon as the mule was near enough to the pillory to allow of its rider recognizing the victim, the priest dropped his eyes, beat a hasty retreat, spurred on rigorously, as though in haste to rid himself of humiliating appeals, and not at all desirous of being saluted and recognized by a poor fellow in such a predicament.This priest was Archdeacon Dom Claude Frollo.The cloud descended more blackly than ever upon Quasimodo's brow.The smile was still mingled with it for a time, but was bitter, discouraged, profoundly sad.Time passed on.He had been there at least an hour and a half, lacerated, maltreated, mocked incessantly, and almost stoned.All at once he moved again in his chains with redoubled despair, which made the whole framework that bore him tremble, and, breaking the silence which he had obstinately preserved hitherto, he cried in a hoarse and furious voice, which resembled a bark rather than a human cry, and which was drowned in the noise of the hoots--\"Drink!\"",
